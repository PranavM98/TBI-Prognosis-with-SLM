Box 3. SIBICC I Tiers for ICP Treatment of Intracranial 
Hypertension for Patients with ICP Monitoring
Tier One
 
• Maintain CPP 60–70 mm Hg
 
• Increase analgesia to lower ICP
 
• Increase sedation to lower ICP
 
• Maintain PaCO2 at low end of normal (35–38 mm 
Hg/4.7–5.1 kPa)
 
• Administer mannitol by intermittent bolus 

(0.25–1.0 g/kg)*
 
• Administer hypertonic saline by intermittent bolus*
 
• Drain CSF if EVD is in situ
 
• Consider placement of EVD to drain CSF if 
parenchymal probe used initially
 
• Consider anti-seizure prophylaxis for 1 week only (in 
the absence of indication to continue)
 
• Consider electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring
Tier Two
 
• Maintain mild hypocapnia (32–35 mm Hg/4.3–4.6 
 
• Use neuromuscular paralysis in adequately sedated 
patients, if efficacious in lowering ICP**
 
• Perform a MAP Challenge† to assess cerebral 
autoregulation and guide MAP and CPP goals in 
individual patients (see page 29 in Neuromonitoring)
 
• Adjust the target MAP back to baseline (disrupted 
autoregulation) or to a new, elevated target to lower 
ICP (intact autoregulation)
Tier Three
 
• Administer pentobarbital or sodium thiopentone. 
The barbiturate coma is titrated to ICP control if it is 
efficacious on testing††
 
• Perform secondary decompressive craniectomy
 
• Maintain mild hypothermia (35–36°C) using active 
cooling measures
* Limits for sodium (155 mEq/L) and osmolality (320 mEq/L) are 
recommended for administration of either hypertonic saline or mannitol.
** It is recommended to begin with a trial dose of neuromuscular paralysis 
and only proceed to continuous infusion if efficacy is demonstrated.
† See MAP challenge protocol described in the open access papers, 
references 1 and 2.
†† Barbiturate administration is continued only when a beneficial effect on 
ICP is demonstrated. Titrate barbiturate to achieve ICP control, but do not 
exceed the dose that achieves burst suppression. Avoid hypotension when 
barbiturates are administered.
