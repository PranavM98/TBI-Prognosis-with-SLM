PATIENT MANAGEMENT
25
Although implementation of evidence-based TBI guidelines 
is associated with marked improvement in outcome, these 
guidelines are restricted to what is available in the scientific 
literature. The Delphi-based consensus process is valuable 
to bridge gaps in evidence upon which treatment algorithms 
are based until formal evidence is generated. SIBICC used 
this rigorous consensus process to tap into the collective 
wisdom of experts and produce the first severe TBI 
management algorithms published in a generation.1,2 
The SIBICC algorithms are a suggestion for care, not a 
standard of care. They aim to be comprehensive, providing a 
consensus-based approach with the goals of standardizing 
care and minimizing treatment variability. The full SIBICC 
documents provide three-tiered algorithms and address the 
following:
 
• Management of ICP and ICP + low PbtO2 
 
• Interventions to be discouraged 
 
• A definition of clinical neurologic worsening and its 
management
 
• Recommendations for weaning therapy
Tiered Treatments
The SIBICC algorithms are organized into tiers, with 
treatments placed into individual tiers based on 
their relative risk-benefit ratios. Tier Zero represents 
interventions either expected or recommended for all 
patients with TBI admitted to the ICU, regardless of their 
ICP (e.g., basic ICU care). Tiers One, Two, and Three are 
directed at management of intracranial hypertension. 
Guidance for using tiered treatments is based on three 
principles:
 
• No ranked ordering of treatments exists within an 
individual tier
 
• It is not necessary to use all modalities in a lower tier 
before moving to the next tier
 
• If considered advantageous, tiers can be skipped 
when advancing treatment (e.g., early decompressive 
craniectomy)
