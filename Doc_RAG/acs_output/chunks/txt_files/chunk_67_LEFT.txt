Rehabilitation specialists (sports medicine, PM&R, PT, OT, 
SLP, and neuropsychology) can provide a multidisciplinary 
evaluation and treatment recommendations to address 
persistent symptoms. 
Transition of Care Recommendations
A continuous chain of ongoing, individualized rehabilitation 
services is recommended beyond the ED, ICU, and 
acute care, including consideration for coordination and 
continuity of postdischarge care.22 In hospitalized patients, 
begin discharge planning for the next level of care early, 
following admission to the trauma setting. Postacute care 
options include long-term acute care hospitals, inpatient 
rehabilitation facilities, skilled nursing facilities, outpatient 
rehabilitation programs, and home- and community-based 
services.8 
Many patients with moderate or severe TBI have complex, 
ongoing medical needs that warrant continued medical 
and nursing management in an inpatient rehabilitation 
setting. The primary objective is to identify a discharge 
disposition that has proper support and expertise to meet 
the medical, functional, and neurobehavioral needs of the 
patient to promote continued recovery. A growing body of 
evidence suggests that patients with moderate or severe 
TBI who have access to specialized postacute rehabilitation 
services have a higher probability of achieving functional 
independence and ongoing improvement in long-term 
outcome.23,24 Planning the transition from inpatient care 
to outpatient, community-based services and resources 
is needed to ensure that patients and families have the 
necessary support to navigate the healthcare system and 
manage the patientâ€™s recovery.25 
Older Adult Considerations
Little evidence exists to guide rehabilitation specifically 
for older adults with TBI. However, the Acute Care for 
Elders (ACE) unit model brings rehabilitation into the 
acute care setting. There is substantial evidence that the 
ACE model improves outcomes among older adults with 
acute medical conditions and that early mobilization 
improves outcomes among older adults with hip fracture.2,7 
Furthermore, most studies focusing on early mobilization
