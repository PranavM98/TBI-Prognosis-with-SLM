TRIAGE AND TRANSPORT
KEY POINTS
 
• Rapidly transport adult and pediatric patients with 
suspected TBI who meet any high-risk criteria from the 
scene to the highest-level trauma center available.
 
• During transport, monitor patients with suspected TBI 
for hypotension, hypoxia, hypercarbia, and hypothermia, 
and begin corrective actions.
Proper field triage is critical for adult and pediatric patients 
with suspected TBI. Trauma patients with TBI can require 
rapid resuscitation, surgical intervention, and critical care 
management to prevent secondary brain injury. Refer to 
the ACS National Guideline for the Field Triage of Injured 
Patients.1 Emergency medical services clinicians are directed 
to transport all patients to the highest-level trauma center 
when TBI is suspected and any of the following high-risk 
criteria are present:
 
• Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) motor score < 6
 
• GCS total score < 13 
 
• Skull deformity or suspected skull fracture
 
• Signs of basilar skull fracture
 
• Penetrating head injury
 
• Caregiver report of baseline behavior change in an 
infant/child following injury
Within the geographic constraints of the regional trauma 
system, trauma centers provide the expertise, personnel, 
and facilities to rapidly deliver definitive care for patients 
with TBI. Suspect TBI for all trauma patients with an 
altered mental state, who are “found down,” or with any 
neurologic signs and symptoms following a high-energy 
impact mechanism of injury or any reported head impact. 
Have a high index of suspicion for TBI in young children 
(age < 5 years) or older adults (age > 65 years) with 
significant head impact following a low-level fall or concern 
for nonaccidental trauma. Preferentially triage children to 
pediatric-capable centers.
