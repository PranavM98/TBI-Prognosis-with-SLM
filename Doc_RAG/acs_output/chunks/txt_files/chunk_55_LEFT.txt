• Levetiracetam is an ASM with a better pharmacokinetic 
profile and minimal ADRs relative to phenytoin. 
However, it was observed to have associated behavioral 
ADRs in both pediatric and adult patients, particularly 
those with TBI.11-15 Pyridoxine 50–100 mg daily 
supplementation may limit these behavioral ADRs.16 
 
• Valproic acid is not recommended for early PTS 
prophylaxis due to an increased risk of death compared 
to phenytoin.17 
Do not continue PTS prophylaxis for more than 7 days in 
patients with no clinical or EEG seizure activity, or with 
seizure activity only within the first 24 hours postinjury. 
Seizure prophylaxis may be continued if seizure activity 
occurs beyond 24 hours or if the patient was previously 
receiving medication for a known seizure disorder.
Anticoagulant Management in TBI Patients 
Anticoagulant reversal: Consider anticoagulant reversal 
for patients with TBI who were taking an anticoagulant 
medication prior to admission, in order to allow them to 
safely undergo emergent surgery and/or to help prevent 
hematoma expansion. A specific reversal agent is generally 
recommended for each available oral anticoagulant 
medication. If the last dose of a DOAC was within the 
past 8–12 hours (or the INR is elevated ≥ 1.5 for patients 
receiving warfarin), the benefits of a reversal agent will 
most likely outweigh the risks. 
When prescribing four-factor prothrombin complex 
concentrates (4PCCs), some providers choose to use fixed 
doses of 1500 to 2500 units rather than using weight-based 
dosing strategies for anticoagulant reversal. Lower doses 
of 4PCC (10–20 units/kg) are suggested for patients with 
an INR 1.5–1.9, as higher doses (> 2000 to 3000 units) 
were associated with increased VTE risk in patients with 
nontraumatic ICH.18,19  
Note: If 4PCC is not available and fresh frozen 
plasma (FFP) is administered, approximately 8–16 
units of FFP are equivalent to approximately 20–50 
units/kg of 4PCC. The lowest achievable INR for FFP 
alone is approximately 1.5–1.7; the mean intrinsic INR 
of FFP is 1.1, but it can range from 0.9–1.3.
