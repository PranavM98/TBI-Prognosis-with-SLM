PATIENT MANAGEMENT

in adults needing critical care include patients over the 
age of 60 years.7,9 Together, the evidence supports early 
rehabilitation and early mobilization in the older adult TBI 
population. The acute care rehabilitation plan is ideally 
developed in consultation with a multidisciplinary team 
including geriatric medicine expertise, given older adultsâ€™ 
increased risk for medical complications, high burden of 
care, discharge to an institutional setting, and decreased 
quality of life.26 Key components of most ACE unit models 
include all of the rehabilitation strategies, including 
mobilization, delirium prevention, reduction of inappropriate 
medications/polypharmacy, and a focus on improving or 
maintaining function according to individual goals of care. 
Pediatric Considerations
Pediatric patients with TBI are at risk for developing critical 
illness comorbidities and complications related to sedation, 
immobility, and delirium. A recent review reported global 
dysfunction in 47% of children at the time of pediatric 
ICU discharge, with 76% reporting residual disabilities 6 
months after discharge.27 Multidisciplinary rehabilitation of 
pediatric patients needing critical care was found to be safe, 
with minimal adverse events; it minimized the number of 
days on mechanical ventilation, in bed, and in the ICU; and 
it reduced comorbidities and decreased delirium.28,29 It was 
also found to be effective in enhancing functional outcomes 
and lessening family and caregiver burden in pediatric and 
adolescent patients with TBI.30 Pay careful attention to 
patients with a preinjury comorbid mental or personality 
condition. Behavioral health medicine would be an 
appropriate addition to the multidisciplinary rehabilitation 
team to provide nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic 
recommendations.
