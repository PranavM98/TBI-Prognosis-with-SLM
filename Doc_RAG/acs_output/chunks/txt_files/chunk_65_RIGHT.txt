PATIENT MANAGEMENT
65
Critical illness after moderate or severe TBI can lead to 
prolonged periods of immobility and mechanical ventilation, 
increasing the risk of acquiring various comorbidities. 
Immobility negatively impacts all body systems.1 
Comorbidities can include venous thromboembolism, skin 
breakdown, contractures, deconditioning, delirium, and 
systemic syndromes such as ICU-acquired weakness.2,3 
These negative outcomes can persist for years.3,4 When 
evidence-based practice guidelines and protocols to 
manage pain, agitation, delirium, immobility, and sleep5 
(e.g., the ABCDEF bundle) were implemented in the 
ICU setting, the following patient outcomes were found: 
decreased mortality, decreased comorbidities, improved 
functional outcomes, and improved quality of life.6 Recent 
evidence supports early rehabilitation for patients with 
TBI to mitigate the negative impact of immobility, avoid 
secondary complications, and improve function.7
Multidisciplinary Rehabilitation 
Collaboration
The standards in the 2022 ACS Resources for Optimal Care 
of the Injured Patient direct trauma settings to provide 
the necessary staffing and resources to support early 
multidisciplinary rehabilitation and mobilization for patients 
with moderate to severe TBI, because these interventions 
foster recovery.8,9 Implementation of early multidisciplinary 
rehabilitation positively impacts LOS, reduces healthcare 
costs and resource use, and maximizes long-term functional 
outcomes.4 Rehabilitation specialists are experienced 
in providing early skilled evaluation and therapeutic 
interventions, objectively measuring the effectiveness of 
interventions, monitoring physiologic responses, advancing 
mobility, and guiding the gradual progression from low- to 
high-intensity modalities. These interventions facilitate 
stabilization, promote resumption of functional routines, 
and quantify patient progression and recovery. They 
can also support the trauma team through provision of 
evidence-based recommendations to guide treatment and 
discharge planning. 
The benefits of early rehabilitation are optimized when 
rehabilitation specialists are integrated into the trauma 
team. The multidisciplinary team needs to include, but 
is not limited to, PM&R physicians, nurses, PT, OT, SLP, 
psychologists/neuropsychologists, and social workers. It is 
recommended that the PM&R physician be a key member
