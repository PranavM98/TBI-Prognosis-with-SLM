PATIENT MANAGEMENT

Posttraumatic Seizure Prophylaxis
Incidence of PTS: Early PTS (< 7 days) are correlated 
with severity of TBI injury, and patients with penetrating 
injuries have the highest incidence.1,2 Other high-risk 
patients include those who experience an immediate PTS 
or have depressed skull fractures, SDH, ICH, GCS < 10, or 
cortical contusions.3 Early PTS is also associated with TBI 
morbidity and mortality, and increased risk of developing 
post traumatic epilepsy (PTE).4,5 Findings from an RCT 
reported early PTS incidence of 14.2% in the placebo group, 
as compared to 3.6% of patients assigned to phenytoin.3  
However, early seizure prophylaxis did not prevent PTE, 
highlighting the need for a contemporary randomized 
clinical study.
PTS prophylaxis: Consider the use of ASM prophylaxis for 
7 days following TBI to prevent early PTS if risk factors are 
present; however, its use for more than 7 days to prevent 
late PTS is not recommended. Seizure prophylaxis is not 
recommended in TBI patients  without intracranial bleeding, 
or in patients with isolated traumatic subarachnoid 
hemorrhage.6,7 
Currently the most studied ASMs for PTS are 

(fos)phenytoin, levetiracetam, and valproic acid. Of these, 
phenytoin and levetiracetam appear to be similar in safety 
and efficacy for early PTS for patients at risk.8 However, 
the incidence of early PTS in these studies was low, 
and superiority of one drug over the other could not be 
determined. 
 
â€¢ Phenytoin is an older ASM that requires therapeutic 
drug monitoring to assure target concentrations are 
achieved. It is usually monitored 24 hours after initial 
dosing and once more during the 7 days of prophylaxis 
in TBI patients. However, phenytoin has many drug-
drug interactions, as well as potentially severe adverse 
drug reactions (ADRs). Phenytoin is also highly bound 
to albumin, so monitoring albumin and free phenytoin 
concentrations is essential to guide dosing adjustments. 
If laboratory assays for free phenytoin are not available, 
correction of total phenytoin concentrations can be 
calculated.9,10
