Table 5. The Utah Score for Assessment of BCVI in Pediatric 
Patients
Variables
Score
GCS ≤ 8
1
Focal neurological deficits
2
Carotid canal fracture
2
Petrous temporal bone fracture
3
Cerebral infarction on CT

A maximum of 11 points are possible. A score ≥ 3 conferred an 18% risk of 
BCVI, while a score ≤ 2 was associated with less than 3% risk.

Implementation of these risk stratification systems is 
suggested to identify patients at high risk who need to 
receive dedicated arch-to-vertex CT angiography. Like the 
adult recommendations, treatment with antiplatelet or 
anticoagulation therapy is initiated after BCVI diagnosis, 
based on intracranial injury stability and extracranial 
hemorrhage source control. Further evidence is required 
to identify specific treatment duration recommendations. 
Treatment should be individualized; however, consider 
surgery or endovascular therapy for higher-grade injuries 
(Biffl grade ≥ 3) or for patients with progressive lesions 
receiving medical therapy.36–38
