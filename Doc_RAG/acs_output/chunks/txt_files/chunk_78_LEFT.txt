to define outcome trajectories suggesting improvement, 
prolonged plateau, or worsening that may indicate need to 
intervene to improve outcome.9 The recommended timeline 
is suggested to balance the need for serial assessment to 
acquire prognostically important trajectory data against 
clinical and operational feasibility. However, individual 
patients may be selected for more frequent monitoring. 
Outcome assessment is important both on the individual 
patient level and on the broader systems level. Following 
individual patient trajectories can help identify when 
recovery is not progressing as expected, thereby indicating 
the need for further evaluation and treatment. Data 
obtained at multiple time points aids the clinical team in 
determining if an individual has plateaued or declined. 
It can also inform decision-making about the need for 
further evaluation (e.g., imaging, laboratory evaluation, 
comprehensive neuropsychological assessment, and 
driver reevaluation) and treatment (e.g., inpatient 
rehabilitation, outpatient cognitive rehabilitation program, 
concussion clinic, and psychological counseling) services. 
Postdischarge assessments revealing plateau or decline 
may be an indication of medical or psychiatric conditions 
that are amenable to intervention or may indicate adverse 
environmental conditions. On a broader systems level, 
evaluation of observed versus expected patient outcomes 
weeks to months after they leave the hospital, within 
and across trauma programs, can help identify process 
improvement opportunities in the care delivery system. 
Older Adult Considerations
Older adult trauma patients with TBI are at greater risk for 
complications and poor outcomes after injury, compared 
to younger patients.10–13 These outcomes include longer 
hospital LOS,10 higher mortality,10,14,15 greater functional and 
cognitive decline,12,14,15 poorer health-related quality of life,12 
more readmissions to acute care,11 more complications,11 
and discharge to facilities other than home.11,16 Even with 
comparatively lower injury severity scores, older patients 
have the highest rates of hospitalization after injury, 
mortality, functional decline, and cost of care.13 Moreover, 
older adults are at higher risk of secondary complications, 
including VTE, hemorrhage,13,17 and neurodegeneration 
(all-cause dementia, Parkinson’s disease).18 In terms of 
recovery and disability trajectories after injury, a patient’s
