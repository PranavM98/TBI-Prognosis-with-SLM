Box 7. Factors Associated with a Higher Risk for 
Posttraumatic Epilepsy

• Contusion and SDH3 
 
• Evacuation of intraparenchymal hematoma10 
 
• GCS 3–810–12 
 
• Early seizures (particularly if delayed)10–12 
 
• Loss of consciousness or amnesia > 1 day3

(> 7 days)10

• Parietal lesions10 
 
• Age > 65 years2 
 
• Female sex11 
 
• Family history of epilepsy11 
 
• History of depression12 
Furthermore, the cumulative risk (increased incidence over 
time) of PTE is greater after TBI, especially for severe TBI, 
but also for moderate TBI.2 For patients experiencing early 
seizures, PTE was reported to occur at higher rates among 
those with intracerebral hemorrhage and greater injury 
severity.2 Given that cumulative incidence of PTE increases 
over time, carefully monitor aging adult patients with a 
history of TBI, particularly those with risk factors for PTE. 
One population-based study found that mild TBI patients 
had a greater risk of seizures for up to 10 years, compared 
to the general population (relative risk 2.06–3.51, increasing 
by age group).11 However, PTE was found to be most 
common in patients with more severe injuries (relative risk 
4.91–12.24, depending on age group). For both mild and 
severe TBI, the risk of PTE was highest for those > 15 years 
of age, and the seizures mostly occurred earlier after injury.
