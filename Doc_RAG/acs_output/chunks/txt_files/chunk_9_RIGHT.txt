Posttraumatic Amnesia: Posttraumatic amnesia (PTA) 
is widely used as an indicator of injury severity, but it can 
be difficult to assess in many patients early after injury. It 
is a more relevant assessment for rehabilitation settings.

was developed primarily for use in patients with impaired 
consciousness in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting.
