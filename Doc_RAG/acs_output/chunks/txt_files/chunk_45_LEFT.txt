Older Adult Considerations
The average age of polytrauma patients has increased 
over time.16 Severe TBI and age > 65 years are known to 
be independent prognostic factors for mortality during the 
initial hospital stay. Older adult patients presenting with 
polytrauma are vulnerable to more severe injury, longer LOS, 
and a greater likelihood of mortality than younger patients 
with similar injuries.16 These findings are associated with 
geriatric patients having a greater likelihood of comorbid 
medical conditions, preexisting neurologic or psychiatric 
diagnoses, and chronic antiplatelet or anticoagulant 
therapy.17 Weigh these factors when contemplating 
extracranial interventions, because they may influence 
decisions with respect to the timing and the extent of 
procedures to be performed.
Pediatric Considerations
Children frequently experience polytrauma in association 
with TBI, and at least a third of children with severe TBI 
require extracranial surgery.18 The severity of TBI is also a 
major determinant of outcome in children with polytrauma, 
similar to the findings in adults.19 No definitive data exist 
to suggest a different management pattern in the surgical 
care of extracranial injuries for children. Thus, prioritize 
hemodynamic stability to minimize significant secondary 
brain injury.20,21
