Older Adult Considerations
Antithrombotic/antiplatelet reversal and restart: 
Although older adult patients are more likely to receive 
anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents for comorbidities 
preinjury, available evidence does not suggest a difference 
in the risk of worse outcomes for older adult patients 
with TBI undergoing neurosurgery, despite the use of an 
anticoagulant or antiplatelet agent.53–55 The anticoagulant 
used and the number of antiplatelet agents, however, 
may impact the risk of worse outcomes. Time to restart 
of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents is similar for all 
patients, regardless of age. 
Antibiotic prophylaxis: When selecting an antibiotic and 
dose for surgical prophylaxis or treatment, older adults’ 
physiologic, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic 
changes must be considered to help avoid unwanted 
adverse effects or toxicity. 
Pediatric Considerations
PTS prophylaxis: Pediatric data are in line with adult data 
as described for PTS prophylaxis. PTS may be more likely 
to occur in children less than 24 months old, those with 
severe injury (GCS < 8), and those suffering nonaccidental 
trauma.56–60 Despite the growing popularity of levetiracetam 
for PTS prophylaxis in children with TBI, evidence for its 
efficacy remains limited, with one recent observational 
trial demonstrating seizures in 17% of children treated with 
levetiracetam prophylaxis after TBI.61 As a result, either 
levetiracetam or (fos)phenytoin is appropriate for the 
recommended 7-day course of prophylaxis. Levetiracetam 
has a more favorable adverse effect profile, and therapeutic 
drug monitoring is not needed. The most commonly used 
dose of levetiracetam is 20–40 mg/kg/day, divided into 
two doses per day. Facilities are encouraged to develop 
multidisciplinary guidelines, with weight-based dosing, for 
pediatric PTS prophylaxis.
Antithrombotic/antiplatelet reversal and restart: As 
in adult patients, consideration of anticoagulant and 
antiplatelet reversal and restart in pediatric patients 
requires a thorough risk-benefit analysis for each individual 
patient before making clinical decisions.
