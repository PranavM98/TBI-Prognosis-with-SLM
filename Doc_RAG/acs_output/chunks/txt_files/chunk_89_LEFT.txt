IMPLEMENTATION AND INTEGRATION OF THE BEST PRACTICES GUIDELINES
Performance Improvement Recommendations
Outcome Measure and Threshold
Initiation of VTE prophylaxis
Nonoperative TBI**
 
• GCS 13–15 TBI: initiate within 24 hours 
 
• GCS 3–12 TBI: initiate within 48 hours
** Provided follow-up head CT indicates hemorrhage stability 
Operative TBI 
 
• Consider initiating or resuming 24–48 hours after surgery and if ICH 
is stable upon postop CT scan 
Monitor:
 
• Time to initiation 
 
• Pharmacologic agent used
Initiation of anticoagulant reversal
Refer to Table 7 on page 56 for anticoagulation reversal strategy for TBI 
patients needing emergent surgery
Initiation of seizure prophylaxis
Early (first 7 days only) prevention of PTS 
Documentation surrounding withdrawal of life-supporting 
treatment 
Ensure program is capturing the reason, date, and time of care withdrawal 
Documented guidelines for brain death determination
Per individual facility
Psychological support, TBI education, and resources provided 
to the patient and the family, starting at admission
Per individual facility
Plan available to patients for postacute care of TBI with GCS 
13–15, including educational resources and referral guidelines
Provide the following to patients with TBI and GCS 13–15:
 
• Educational resources about their injury
 
• Referral guidelines 
 
• Information regarding outlets for follow-up care for those who 
experience persistent symptoms
Concussion (GCS 13-15) care resources pertinent to the 
postacute injury period are available
A process is established with criteria identifying patients needing referral 
for concussion and TBI management services
Rehabilitation consultation
Rehabilitation consultation is ordered within a day of hospital admission
A multidisciplinary service team is a vital component of TBI 
management 
Multidisciplinary service team includes PM&R physician
Incorporation of evidenced-based guidelines to help manage 
pain and potential complications
Per individual facility; one example is the ABCDEF bundle
Rehabilitation includes a postacute phase for continuation 
when the patient is medically stabile and cleared for discharge 
from acute care
Patient is referred to specialized postacute rehabilitation
