of the trauma team and be involved in the care of the 
patient from the day of admission. Early PM&R consultation 
is associated with greater mobility and cognitive 
independence, as well as a shorter acute care LOS.10 PM&R 
physicians can provide insight into outcome expectations 
and assist with prognostic communications. 
Rehabilitation for GCS 3–12
Early multidisciplinary rehabilitation interventions, provided 
by PT, OT, SLP, and nursing, can be implemented at the 
bedside while medical stability is being achieved. Treatment 
interventions through PT, OT, and SLP for patients with 
severe TBI presenting with consciousness impairments can 
focus on serial assessment of LOC, arousal optimization 
through various modalities of stimulation, environmental 
adaptation, and early mobilization.11 
Early mobilization: Early mobilization is defined as 
initiation of mobilization activities within the first 48 hours 
of injury, or as soon as neurosurgical, hemodynamic, and 
respiratory stability are achieved. A multitude of evidence 
demonstrates the efficacy of early mobilization.1,4,9,12 See Box 
6 for early mobilization activities.
Box 6. Early Mobilization Activities
 
• Passive range of motion 
 
• Active range of motion 
 
• Bed mobility 
 
• Leg ergometer 
 
• Neuromuscular electrical stimulation 
 
• Upright positioning 
 
• Sitting on edge of bed 
 
• Transfers 
 
• Out-of-bed mobility 
 
• Ambulation 
 
• Resistive exercise and engagement in activities of 
daily living
These interventions are an essential feature of early 
rehabilitation in the ICU to mitigate the deleterious impact 
of immobility, and they are safe and feasible.12,13 Simple 
interventions (such as passive movement and splinting)
