infrared light to measure a pupil, capture its response to 
a light stimulus, and quantify the pupil’s characteristics. It 
has six items measured (see Box 1). In pediatric patients, 
however, developmental changes in myelination during 
infancy can alter the normal latency observed, potentially 
limiting the application of a priori thresholds.14,15 
Box 1. Output from Quantitative Pupillometer
 
• Starting diameter (mm)
 
• Ending diameter (mm)
 
• % Change
 
• Latency (s)
 
• Average constriction velocity (mm/s)
 
• Average dilation velocity (mm/s)
Clinical experience shows that quantitative pupillometry 
can facilitate a more accurate clinical assessment by 
providing an objective and reliable assessment of pupillary 
reactivity. Pupillary changes may be detected before 
a provider’s clinical assessment of pupillary size and 
reactivity, thus providing an early warning sign. Quantitative 
pupillometry can assess reactivity even when opioids and 
other drugs result in small pupils, which make clinical 
assessment difficult. Moreover, the pupillometry output 
can be directly entered into the patient’s electronic medical 
record.
