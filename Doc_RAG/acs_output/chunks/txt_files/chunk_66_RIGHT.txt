PATIENT MANAGEMENT

can be implemented soon after admission to maintain joint 
mobility, reduce contractures, and reduce late burden of 
disability, even in patients who require ongoing treatment 
to control ICP or symptoms of paroxysmal sympathetic 
hyperactivity.14,15 Note: Use caution with more severely 
injured patients, as some interventions (e.g., mobilization 
out of bed) are only appropriate once hemodynamic 
and ventilatory stability are achieved and intracranial 
hypertension is no longer a significant issue.
Management of posttraumatic confusion and agitation: 
Moderate or severe TBI can present with posttraumatic 
confusion and agitation. Agitation is common, occurring 
in approximately 40% of patients.16 Acute use of 
benzodiazepines and typical antipsychotic medications 
is not recommended, because evidence suggests it can 
protract neurocognitive recovery. Atypical antipsychotics, 
as well as beta blockers such as propranolol, can be 
considered as an alternative in the acute phases of agitation 
to ensure safety for patients and staff.17 Multidisciplinary 
rehabilitation assessment and treatment of posttraumatic 
confusion and agitation can lead to development of 
behavioral modification approaches that can increase 
patient engagement in rehabilitation, minimize dependency, 
improve safety, and limit the need for pharmacologic 
interventions.18 
Interventions to promote resumption of self-care and 
activities of daily living (ADLs): Evaluation and treatment 
of dysphagia and other oral motor dysfunction by SLP and 
OT can improve nutritional intake and normalize eating 
routines. SLP and OT providers can also evaluate the need 
for alternative and augmentative communication systems to 
improve interpersonal interactions and patient autonomy.19 
Evidence from a RCT indicated that retraining for self-care 
and ADLs can be initiated during posttraumatic confusion, 
leading to faster improvement in functional independence 
and shorter LOS.20 
Rehabilitation for GCS 13–15
Up to 90% of all patients with TBI present with a GCS of 13–
15.21 Symptoms can last for months or years if left untreated 
and can result in disability. Patients with TBI and GCS of 
13–15 experiencing prolonged symptoms benefit from 
referral to a multidisciplinary rehabilitation team, usually 
provided in an outpatient or community setting, to support
