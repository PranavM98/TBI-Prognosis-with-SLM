narrower window of appropriate CPP and ICP may exist 
in children as compared to adults. CPP goals above 50 
mm Hg for patients aged 6 to 17 years, and above 40 mm 
Hg in children aged 0 to 5 years, seem to be appropriate 
targets for treatment-based studies.16 Studies in ICP targets 
among children may be limited by the use of 20 mm Hg as 
a priori target for treatments. Current literature does not 
report improved outcomes among children with specific 
ICP targets lower than 20 mm Hg, and further research is 
needed.
