POSTTRAUMATIC EPILEPSY
KEY POINTS
•	
Prior to acute care hospital discharge, educate families 
regarding the signs and symptoms of posttraumatic 
epilepsy (PTE), including subtle changes in level of 
consciousness.
•	
Screen patients for the presence of PTE during the 
follow-up period and arrange for further diagnostic 
testing when potential seizure activity exists.
•	
Patients developing PTE require treatment with ASM 
and referral to a clinician with expertise in management 
of PTE.
•	
Tailor the choice and duration of ASM therapy for PTE 
to individual patient characteristics, including seizure 
control, side effects, and other treatment options such 
as dietary modifications, neuromodulation, and other 
surgical approaches.
•	
The incidence of PTE increases over time, so perform 
ongoing screening of aging adults with a history of TBI, 
particularly in patients with risk factors for PTE.
Incidence
TBI accounted for about 4% of epilepsy patient diagnoses in 
earlier population-based studies,1,2 with other studies citing 
incidence as high as 20%.3,4 Late PTS is defined as seizures 
occurring more than 7 days postinjury. In general, ASM 
prophylaxis is not recommended to prevent late seizures, 
because the potential for adverse effects outweighs the 
risk of seizures for many patients.5–7 A significant portion 
of patients post-TBI develop PTE, which carries significant 
morbidity and mortality, and these patients require 
treatment.3,8,9 See Box 7 for factors associated with a higher 
risk for PTE.
