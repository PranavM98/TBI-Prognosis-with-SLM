PATIENT MANAGEMENT
42
The BTF 4th edition guidelines for patients with severe 
TBI provide a Level IIA recommendation for performing 
early tracheostomy to reduce ventilation days. However, 
the recommendation makes no statement regarding 
an associated reduction of mortality or pneumonia.4 
Limited evidence exists to recommend either surgical or 
percutaneous tracheostomy in the setting of TBI, but a 
percutaneous procedure can be safe and well tolerated. 
Consider performing an early tracheostomy for patients 
with severe TBI who are unlikely to be liberated from the 
ventilator within 7 days.5 
Older Adult Considerations
Multiple studies reported that older adult patients are less 
likely to undergo a tracheostomy.6,7 When tracheostomy is 
performed in older patients, it is often performed later in 
the hospital course than for younger patients.7 This is true 
despite the fact that tracheostomies in older patients are 
reported to be associated with lower in-hospital mortality.7 
Both tracheostomy placement and oral intubation are 
independent risk factors for the development of dysphagia, 
a common complication in injured older adults.8 Performing 
a tracheostomy in an older adult with severe TBI must be 
weighed against the patient’s goals of care. 
Pediatric Considerations
Tracheostomy timing for children was studied 
retrospectively based on a single center and national North 
American databases.9 Similar to the adult evidence, early 
tracheostomy is suggested to decrease ICU morbidity and 
LOS in pediatric TBI.9–11 However, less information exists 
about tracheostomy timing for infants with abusive head 
trauma.10 Adolescents likely benefit from similar early 
tracheostomy strategies as adults.
Children under 10 years old may have a different risk profile 
for tracheostomy. Therefore, it may be inappropriate to 
extrapolate the benefits seen in early tracheostomy after 
TBI from adults and adolescents to younger children and 
infants. Additionally, the technique and complication 
profile of tracheostomy in children may be different than 
in adults. In children, particularly those under 10 years of 
age, the percutaneous technique is uncommon compared 
to its frequency of use in the adult ICU setting.12–14 Airway
