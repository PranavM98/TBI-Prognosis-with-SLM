OUTCOME ASSESSMENT AND 
QUALITY IMPROVEMENT
KEY POINTS
 
• Perform a TBI outcome assessment using both global 
and multidimensional measures, including physical, 
cognitive, communication, behavioral, psychological, and 
well-being.
 
• To assure quality care benchmarking, identify patient-
specific factors indicating clinical decline or plateau 
associated with pathology requiring intervention or 
treatment, as well as clinical improvement that could be 
further facilitated by rehabilitation or other treatment. 
 
• Perform a TBI outcome assessment at multiple time 
points following injury (ideally, between 1 and 3 months, 
and again between 6 and 12 months) to identify 
postinjury clinical trajectories and intervene as needed 
to optimize recovery.
TBI affects multiple domains of function (e.g., physical, 
cognitive, communication, behavioral, psychological, and 
well-being), and it is a major cause of long-term disability. 
Different manifestations and patterns of impairments 
are patient-specific. TBI outcome trajectories are also 
heterogeneous, and these can range from improvement to 
deterioration over many years following injury. Increasing 
evidence suggests that significant functional recovery from 
TBI continues well beyond 6 months, extending 10 years or 
more postinjury.1 
Individuals hospitalized for TBI need clinical follow-up by 
medical providers with TBI expertise. Given the dynamic 
nature of the post-TBI course, with expectations for changes 
even years after injury, TBI-specific care needs may span 
months to years. Lifelong follow-up may be beneficial 
for many patients to optimize outcomes by addressing 
the screening, monitoring, and management needs of 
individuals living with chronic brain injury to promote their 
brain health.2 
Outcome Assessment
Comprehensive care of patients with TBI requires a 
multidimensional and longitudinal approach to outcome 
assessment. This facilitates accurate documentation of the
