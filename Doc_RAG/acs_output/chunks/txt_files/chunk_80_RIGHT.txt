POSTACUTE CARE
Additionally, nearly 50% of this less severely injured patient 
population receives no education about their TBI injury at 
the time of discharge, and they have no form of postacute 
follow-up care or education.5 
While current TBI education platforms and resources can 
be improved and expanded, numerous resources exist (e.g., 
CDC, Model Systems, and BrainLine).6â€“8 TBI education can 
improve patient outcomes, and encouraging clinician and 
patient use of these existing resources is important.9 An 
important priority for trauma centers is the development of 
coordinated patient education and follow-up systems. 
Healthcare professionals need TBI education to be informed 
about recent data from large-scale studies demonstrating 
that long-term patient outcome may not mirror patient 
presentation. This highlights the need for follow-up patient 
care and education after TBI. Specifically, many patients 
with severe injuries can have good outcomes, while many 
patients with so-called mild injuries can experience 
persistent problems that negatively impact their life 
function. Healthcare professionals also need to be educated 
on patient TBI outcome differences related to sport-related 
TBI versus community-acquired TBI that results in transfer 
to a trauma center.
There is a significant shortage of TBI follow-up care systems 
in the US and worldwide. As a result, the majority of TBI 
patients do not receive adequate follow-up care.5 Many 
symptoms of TBI (e.g., headache, sleep disturbance, various 
forms of cognitive dysfunction, vestibular dysfunction, 
spasticity, weakness, sensory changes, decreased stamina, 
and others) need treatment to prevent disability and 
improve outcomes after TBI. Outcomes are improved with 
TBI follow-up and treatment by clinicians experienced in 
managing TBI.10 Trauma centers and community healthcare 
systems are encouraged to facilitate development of 
coordinated systems for postacute care for TBI patients 
with providers experienced in managing TBI. Peer-to-peer 
TBI support opportunities, such as TBI patient support 
groups, are also important for education and support for 
individuals and families to manage the challenges faced by 
their condition, treatment, and recovery.
