Oral Anticoagulant Agent
Reversal Strategy
Warfarin
 
• 2.5–10 mg of IV vitamin K and:
 
– If INR is 1.5–1.9, give 15 units/kg 4PCC IV
 
– If INR is 2–3.9, give 25 units/kg 4PCC IV
 
– If INR is 4–6, give 35 units/kg 4PCC IV
 
– If INR is > 6, give 50 units/kg 4PCC IV
 
– 1500 units 4PCC (fixed dose)
 
• Recheck INR 1 hour after 4PCC given, if INR is > 1.4, consider administering 2–4 units of 
FFP
 
• Recheck INR 6–8 hours after 4PCC. If INR is > 1.4, administer another 2.5–10 mg of IV 
vitamin K
 
• If the last dose was administered < 2 hours earlier, consider activated charcoal
DOACs 
(rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban)
 
• Andexanet alfa
 
– If last dose was > 7 hours, administer 400 mg IV bolus followed by 480 mg IV 
infusion
 
– If last dose was < 7 hours, administer 800 mg IV bolus followed by 960 mg IV 
infusion
 
• If andexanet alfa is not available, use 25–50 units/kg of 4PCC or a fixed dose of 2000 
units
 
• If the last DOAC dose was > 18–24 hours prior to the bleed, a reversal agent may not be 
beneficial
Thrombin inhibitor (dabigatran)
 
• If the last dose was administered < 2 hours earlier, consider activated charcoal
 
• Administer two consecutive doses of 2.5 g of idarucizumab IV, with each dose being 
infused over 10 minutes
 
• If the last dose was > 24 hours prior to the bleed, a reversal agent may not be beneficial
 
• Consider dialysis in patients with renal failure
 
• If idarucizumab is not available, 4PCC or single factor prothrombin complex concentrate 
PCC 50 unit/kg may be considered
Patients requiring therapeutic anticoagulation prior 
to admission continue to have an underlying risk of 
thrombosis. Therefore, consider VTE prophylaxis with 
subcutaneous heparin or LMWH to prevent further risk 
of thrombosis in the acute period off anticoagulants. Also 
consider the benefit versus harm of reversal based on 
bleeding risk and risk of thrombosis from the underlying 
disease.
Restarting anticoagulation: The available evidence is 
insufficient to recommend the optimal timing to restart 
anticoagulation in patients at moderate to high risk for 
thromboembolic events (e.g., mechanical valve or left 
ventricular assist device patients, history of VTE in the last 
3 months) but not at a high risk for rebleeding. However, 
consider restarting anticoagulation earlier than in lower-
risk patients (e.g., patients with atrial fibrillation and lower 
CHA2DS2-VASc scores, spontaneous ICH, VTE more than 3
