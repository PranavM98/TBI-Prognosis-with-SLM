POSTACUTE CARE
Functional Independence Measure motor score upon 
hospital discharge is a strong predictor of global disability 
as measured by the GOS-E after TBI.12,19 These statistics 
highlight the importance of quality improvement (QI) 
priorities during and after the acute care experience.
Frailty reflects biological aging,20 and it is a primary 
predictor of poor outcomes among older patients.11 This 
emphasizes the importance of frailty screening upon 
hospital admission as a crucial QI initiative at all trauma 
centers.16,21,22 Because of the range of poor outcomes among 
older patients, QI monitoring of outcomes after TBI is 
warranted with risk adjustment for patientsâ€™ frailty status. 
Frailty screening leads to increased consultation with an 
older adult service23 and higher palliative care referrals.21 
Screening also provides the opportunity for patient/
family education regarding measures to mitigate and delay 
functional decline.24 Lifestyle modifications to improve post-
TBI neurocognitive outcomes include exercise, adequate 
sleep, and nutrition.25 Focus rehabilitation strategies on 
increasing function, balance, coordination, and energy 
conservation.12
Pediatric Considerations
Children with TBI also require ongoing standard assessment 
following injury. Pediatric outcome assessment tools include 
but are not limited to the Functional Status Scale and the 
Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory. Healthcare professionals 
caring for pediatric patients with TBI need training to 
administer, interpret, and act upon outcome assessments 
specific to the pediatric population. Of all traumatic injuries 
in hospitalized children, 3% are due to nonaccidental 
trauma, with more than half of these including TBI, either 
independently or as polytrauma.26 Accurate diagnoses and 
close comprehensive outcome assessment are imperative 
for the optimal care of patients for whom social supports, 
including their home environment and caregivers, may 
change.
