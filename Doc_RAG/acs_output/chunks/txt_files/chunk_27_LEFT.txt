Treatments Not Recommended for 
Intracranial Hypertension in Severe TBI
The SIBICC working group lists treatments to be 
discouraged for management of patients with severe TBI. 
The group’s decision-making included both evidence against 
treatments (e.g., steroids, CPP > 70 mm Hg) and lack of 
sufficient supporting evidence (e.g., lumbar CSF drainage, 
scheduled infusion of hyperosmolar therapy). Inclusion in 
this list does not proscribe consideration in some individual 
cases. See Box 4.
Box 4. Treatments Not Recommended for Use in the 
Management of Intracranial Hypertension in Patients with 
Severe TBI
 
• Mannitol by non-bolus, continuous intravenous 
infusion
 
• Scheduled infusion of hyperosmolar therapy

 (e.g., every 4 to 6 hours)
 
• Lumbar CSF drainage
 
• Furosemide
 
• Routine use of steroids
 
• Routine therapeutic hypothermia to temperatures 
below 35°C due to systemic complications
 
• High dose propofol to attempt burst suppression 
 
• Routinely decreasing PaCO2 below 

30 mm Hg/4.0 kPa
 
• Routinely raising CPP above 90 mm Hg
