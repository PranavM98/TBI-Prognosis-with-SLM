PATIENT MANAGEMENT

for carotid injuries and stenting or embolic occlusion for 
vertebral injuries may be safely performed but may also still 
require adjunctive antiplatelet therapy.31
Older Adult Considerations
Data on BCVIs in older adult patients are relatively sparse. 
BCVIs are classically associated with a high-energy injury 
mechanism. Older adults are more commonly injured by 
lower-energy mechanisms, and they may not receive liberal 
screening for BCVI.32 However, older adults are at high risk 
for injuries typically associated with BCVI, such as vertebral 
body fractures. Although the overall incidence of BCVI is 
lower in older adults than in younger cohorts, BCVIs are 
found relatively commonly after ground-level falls.14 The 
consequences of these injuries in older adult patients 
can be devastating. Not only are they more likely to have 
higher-grade lesions, but BCVI in older patients are also 
an independent risk factor for mortality.14,33 Perform liberal 
screening in older adult patients with risk factors for BCVI. 
Pediatric Considerations
Pediatric evaluation for BCVI must consider the additional 
risk of radiation exposure in children. BCVI prevalence is 
lower in the pediatric population compared to adults, and 
application of the Denver criteria would likely overestimate 
BCVI incidence.34 The Utah score is a validated BCVI 
scoring system with high specificity and incorporates risk 
factors to classify patients as “low” or “high” risk of BCVI-
related complication (see Table 5).35,36 The McGovern 
modification adds two points for severe injury mechanism 
related to motor vehicle collision and results in increased 
sensitivity for BCVI diagnosis.37
