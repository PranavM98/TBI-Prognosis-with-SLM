Little guidance exists for discussing prognosis with parents 
in early acute care following severe TBI in children. It 
is important to note that prognosis after abusive head 
trauma may be different from unintentional head trauma. 
Regardless of mechanism, providers play an important role 
in shaping parent reception and synthesis of prognostic 
information, which shapes families’ ability to participate in 
shared decision-making.23 Assessing and supporting parent 
needs during the acute phase of pediatric brain injury may 
improve parent and child outcomes by increasing parents’ 
ability to participate in hospital care and decreasing 
psychological distress. In cases where brain death is 
suspected, use pediatric-specific guidelines.24
