ASSESSMENT

• GCS less than 15 
 
• Age greater than 60 years 
 
• Physical evidence of trauma above the clavicle 
 
• Coagulopathy (supra-therapeutic international 
normalized ratio [INR] or thrombocytopenia) 
 
• Headache 
 
• Vomiting 
 
• Drug or alcohol intoxication 
 
• Short-term memory deficit 
 
• Posttraumatic seizure 
 
• Focal neurologic deficit 
In addition, consider a head CT for patients with no LOC or 
PTA in the following cases: GCS less than 15, age 65 years 
and older, coagulopathy, focal neurologic deficit, severe 
headache, vomiting, physical signs of basilar skull fracture, 
or dangerous mechanism of injury (e.g., ejection from 
motor vehicle, pedestrian struck by motor vehicle, fall down 
five stairs or 3 feet or more).2 Comparable guidelines are 
published in the sports concussion literature and contain 
very similar criteria.6–8 
Older Adult Considerations
Guidance for imaging in older adult patients with suspicion 
of TBI is similar to that used in younger adults. The use of 
anticoagulants in many older patients may complicate the 
recommended indications for imaging. In patients who are 
anticoagulated, the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage 
(ICH) is higher; therefore, a more liberal use of early CT 
scanning may be appropriate.9 Given that current guidelines 
also recommend imaging based on older age, blood-based 
biomarkers may be helpful in identifying older patients with 
GCS 13–15 who do not need CT imaging (refer to the Blood-
Based Biomarkers section on page 15). 
Pediatric Considerations
For children with acute TBI requiring emergent imaging, 
CT is often the first choice because it is rapid, widely 
available, and might not require sedation. However, use 
CT judiciously, due to the greater vulnerability of children 
to radiation-induced malignancy.10,11 In order to mitigate 
the risks of radiation to the developing brain, some trauma 
centers are performing rapid MRI as first-line imaging 
in nonsedated infants and young children.11–13 Regardless
