PATIENT MANAGEMENT

months prior). Available guidelines suggest waiting 2 weeks 
or less for patients at high risk and 7–8 weeks for low-risk 
patients, but not more than 90 days after the bleeding 
event. However, safe restart of anticoagulant medications 
may occur significantly sooner, especially if traumatic 
intracranial bleeding is less significant and/or stable on 
repeat CT imaging.22,28 This guidance is based on available 
clinical evidence, and it is dependent on patient-specific 
thrombosis and bleeding risk factors. 
Note: High-risk warfarin patients receiving high 
doses of vitamin K for reversal (> 2.5 mg) appear to 
have similar time and magnitude of INR reduction, 
but the vitamin K (a fat-soluble vitamin) will likely 
delay warfarin’s therapeutic effect for several weeks 
after restart.29 In such cases, anticoagulation using 
LMWH or unfractionated heparin is needed until the 
effects of the vitamin K have worn off.
