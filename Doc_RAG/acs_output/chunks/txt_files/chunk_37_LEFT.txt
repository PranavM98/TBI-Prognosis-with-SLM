NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
KEY POINT
 
• Initiate enteral nutrition (EN) support once a patient is 
hemodynamically stable, ideally within 24–72 hours of 
injury.
 
• Achieve full nutritional supplementation within 7 days of 
injury.
 
• Postpyloric feeding access is preferred if it can be 
obtained rapidly without delaying initiation of EN. When 
obtaining postpyloric access causes delay in EN support, 
early initiation via gastric access is acceptable.
 
• Consideration for parenteral nutrition (PN) support is 
recommended when EN is contraindicated.
Patients with TBI are at risk for significant protein and 
energy deficits during hospitalization, and they experience 
significant loss of lean body mass during the critical care 
phase of recovery.1 Nutritional support is essential to meet 
the patient’s nutrition requirements, both to prevent the 
development of malnutrition and to blunt the catabolic 
effects of TBI.2,3 
Nutrition Targets
Patients with TBI demonstrate metabolic disturbances 
lasting 1 week to several months following their injury. 
Energy expenditure of 120% to 250% of predicted basal 
expenditure was reported.4–6 Muscle activity, fever, 
infection, and additional injury appear to contribute to 
hypermetabolism, while normothermia protocols may result 
in energy expenditure below predicted levels.7,8 Indirect 
calorimetry is the optimal method to determine caloric 
targets following TBI. One study of patients with critical 
illness and trauma found that patients with TBI did not 
experience increased protein demands compared to trauma 
patients without TBI, and delivery of protein up to 2 g/kg/
day improved nitrogen balance.9 
Initiating Enteral Feeding
Studies, including a large meta-analysis, demonstrated 
that early nutritional support is associated with fewer 
infections and lower mortality.6,10–14 Initiation of EN 
within the first two days of admission following TBI was
