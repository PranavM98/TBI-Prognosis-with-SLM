Antiplatelet Agent Management in TBI 
Patients
Reversal of antiplatelet agent effects: The reversal 
of antiplatelet agent effects in patients with traumatic 
ICH remains controversial. Few relevant RCTs exist, 
and conflicting data were reported about the impact 
on hematoma expansion or neurological outcomes.30-34 
A recent meta-analysis of low-quality data showed no 
difference in hematoma expansion or need for neurosurgical 
intervention in patients on single antiplatelet agents when 
compared to patients on no therapy.35 Additionally, the 
most common treatments for reversal of antiplatelet effects 
(platelet transfusions and desmopressin) are associated 
with adverse effects that may cause further complications 
and worse outcomes. A recent study of patients with 
traumatic ICH found no between-group differences 
in progression of hemorrhage or rate of neurosurgical 
intervention in transfusion versus no-transfusion groups.36 
However, a trend toward increased ICU LOS (adjusted 
odds ratio 1.59, 95% CI 0.74–3.40) and in-hospital death 
(adjusted odds ratio 3.23, 95% CI 0.48–21.74) was found in 
those receiving a platelet transfusion.36 Studies evaluating 
the combination of desmopressin and transfusion also 
demonstrated no benefit in hematoma progression or 
mortality.37 It is important to note that patients receiving 
antiplatelet agents who have a low platelet count and 
undergo invasive procedures (e.g., craniotomy, insertion of 
a ventricular drain, or insertion of an intraparenchymal ICP 
monitor) may benefit from preprocedural transfusion of 
platelets to achieve some degree of circulating functional 
platelets to promote procedural hemostasis. Postoperative 
platelet transfusion is not routinely recommended, because 
antiplatelet medications may continue to affect the 
functionality of transfused platelets. Patients on preinjury 
antiplatelet agents without additional risk factors are not 
recommended to receive platelet transfusions for this 
reason alone. 
Important factors to consider when deciding whether 
to administer therapies reversing preinjury antiplatelet 
agent effects include antiplatelet agent characteristics 
and antiplatelet activity monitoring results. Antiplatelet 
agents are categorized as reversible or irreversible. 
Irreversible agents have effects throughout the platelet 
lifespan (approximately 8–20 days). Transfused platelets
