Brain Death Determination
State law governs the determination of brain death. 
Standardized criteria for the determination of brain death 
exist and should be utilized.15 Criteria specifically include the 
following:
 
• Patients meet prerequisites including cardiopulmonary 
stability and absence of sedative effects 
 
• Patients have no response to central pain, absent 
brainstem reflexes, and an inability to breathe 
independently 
 
• Unless prerequisites for the clinical examination cannot 
be met, the clinical examination is a priority rather than 
an ancillary test, such as CBF assessment 
Each hospital needs to develop a defined brain death 
determination policy derived from accepted standards. 
When relevant, partnering with local organ procurement 
organizations is appropriate to offer families and patients 
the opportunity for organ donation.
Older Adult Considerations
An optimal prognostication model for older adult trauma 
patients with TBI has not been identified, and the IMPACT 
and CRASH TBI statistical models included patients with 
a mean age in the 30s.16 Multiple studies report preinjury 
frailty as the primary predictor of poor outcomes in older 
adult patients.17–20 The ACS TQIP Palliative Care Best Practices 
Guidelines recommend consideration of palliative care 
consultation for patients who screen as frail to facilitate 
advance care planning and goals of care discussions.21 
Pediatric Considerations
Prognostic considerations and family communication 
may be especially challenging in the case of pediatric 
TBI. Pediatric-specific prognosis tools do not perform 
adequately and are not recommended in the context of 
clinical care. Although direct comparison with TBI in adult 
populations is challenging, children may recover better than 
adults with similar injuries because of fewer comorbidities 
and greater capacity for brain plasticity. Indeed, a recent 
study found that good recovery (GOS-E score 7 or 8) was 
observed in 44% of children and 59% of adolescents 
with severe TBI.22 For this reason, aggressive therapy in a 
pediatric ICU is warranted in the vast majority of children 
with severe TBI.
