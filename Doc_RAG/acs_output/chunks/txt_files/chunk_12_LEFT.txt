IMAGING
KEY POINTS
 
• A head CT scan is needed for adult trauma patients with 
an external-force injury mechanism to the head, who 
present with altered mental status, loss of consciousness 
(LOC), PTA, or focal neurologic deficit.
 
• Determine indications for head CT in children using a 
validated decision rule such as the PECARN decision 
guide.
 
• A negative head CT does not rule out a TBI.
 
• Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is more sensitive 
than CT for identification of traumatic intracranial injury.
 
• Traumatic intracranial findings on CT and MRI inform 
prognosis.
Initial Imaging
Head CT is the cornerstone of acute imaging in TBI because 
of its high sensitivity and specificity for identification of 
acute intracranial injury, as well as craniofacial and cervical 
spine fractures. A head CT can be acquired much more 
quickly than an MRI, with total image acquisition time 

< 5 seconds using modern multi-slice CT scanners, a major 
advantage for agitated patients, polytrauma patients, and 
young children.1 Head CT without contrast also has no 
contraindications, unlike MRI (e.g., metallic foreign body 
or implant), which requires a time-consuming screening 
process. For head CT, axial, coronal, and sagittal images 
of the brain with 2.0 mm to 3.75 mm slice thickness are 
recommended, in addition to 0.5 mm to 1.25 mm “bone-
algorithm” images to improve the visibility of craniofacial 
fractures.
Guidelines for Imaging 
A number of guidelines and clinical decision rules provide 
indications for head CT in patients with suspected TBI.2–5 
The CDC/American College of Emergency Physicians 
(ACEP) clinical policy strikes a balance between sensitivity 
and specificity and recommends a non-contrast head CT in 
patients 16 years of age and older with LOC or PTA, if any of 
the following are also present:2
