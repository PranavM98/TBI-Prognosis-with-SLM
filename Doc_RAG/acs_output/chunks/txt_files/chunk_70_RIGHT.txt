PATIENT MANAGEMENT
70
Older Adult Considerations
Older adults have a higher risk of falls than younger adults, 
and TBI due to a fall is reported to have the greatest risk 
for PTE, regardless of TBI severity.17 The risk of PTE is also 
increased in older adults due to comorbidities that impact 
the risk of seizures (e.g., stroke and dementia). The effects 
from ASM drug-drug interaction due to polypharmacy 
can complicate this further.18,19 Selecting the ASM with the 
fewest adverse cognitive effects and drug-drug interactions 
is recommended for management of PTE in the older adult 
population.
Pediatric Considerations
While children are at higher risk for early seizures than 
adults after TBI,20 the development of PTE is less common 
in the pediatric population, except in cases of abusive head 
trauma.21 ASM prophylaxis is not effective for prevention of 
late-onset seizures in children.22 Refer children who develop 
late seizures after TBI to a practitioner with both pediatric 
and epilepsy expertise, such as a pediatric neurologist.
