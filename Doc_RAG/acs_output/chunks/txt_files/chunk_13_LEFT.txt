of which imaging methodology is used, indications for 
emergent head imaging in children need to follow a 
validated pediatric decision rule such as the PECARN 
decision guide. For select pediatric patients with GCS 15, 
no palpable skull fracture, and no findings concerning for 
basilar skull fracture, a brief period of observation (4 to 6 
hours) may obviate the need for neuroimaging, even in the 
presence of 1 or 2 PECARN predictors of clinically important 
TBI.14 See also https://www.cdc.gov/traumatic-brain-injury/

CT and the Incidence and Prognostic 
Implications of Intracranial Injury
The incidence of intracranial injury found on initial head 
CT increases as GCS score decreases. More than 80% of 
patients with GCS 3–12 have evidence of intracranial injury.15 
The Rotterdam CT score uses traumatic intracranial CT 
imaging features (basal cistern effacement, midline shift, 
EDH, IVH, and subarachnoid hemorrhage) to determine a 
score (1 to 6) that is predictive of 6-month mortality related 
to TBI in patients with GCS 3–12. While the incidence of CT 
abnormalities in patients with GCS 13–15 is lower, certain 
features such as subarachnoid hemorrhage, contusion, and 
SDH are associated with incomplete recovery, and IVH and/
or petechial hemorrhage are associated with more severe 
impairment.16 
Clinical Role of MRI
MRI has superior sensitivity relative to CT for most acute 
intracranial findings, including small brain contusions, small 
extra-axial hematomas,17,18 and microhemorrhages and 
small white-matter lesions that represent acute traumatic 
axonal and/or microvascular injury. Several studies reported 
that more than 25% of patients with TBI presenting to 
Level 1 trauma centers with a negative initial head CT are 
determined to have intracranial injuries upon brain MRI.17 
Thus, a negative initial head CT does not rule out a TBI. 
The injuries identified on MRI predict disability in TBI.17,18 
In current clinical practice, brain MRI is used mainly for 
investigation of persistent concerns (e.g., unexplained  
alteration in consciousness in acute TBI, management of 
subacute TBI with persistent symptoms or deficits, and 
identification of intracranial injuries not detected by CT).
