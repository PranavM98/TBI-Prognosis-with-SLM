Paroxysmal Hyperactivity Syndrome 
(“Dysautonomia,” “Sympathetic Storm”)
After TBI, patients can experience loss of inhibitory inputs 
to sympathetic feedback loops, resulting in symptoms such 
as hypertension, tachycardia, hyperpyrexia, tachypnea, or 
diaphoresis. These symptoms can be treated with a variety 
of agents, including beta blockers (BBKs), benzodiazepines, 
opioids, alpha-2 agonists, gabapentin, muscle relaxants, 
and baclofen. Low-quality data suggest that BBKs are 
associated with decreased mortality in patients with severe 
TBI who experience paroxysmal hyperactivity syndrome.42–44 
Most of the larger studies to date were observational or 
retrospective and had the following issues: inconsistency 
in the dose, beta blocking agent, and timing after injury; 
variability in patient characteristics and monitoring of 
adverse events; and whether BBKs were initiated or 
continued for other comorbidities versus only for TBI 
adrenergic stress.42–44 Propranolol, a nonselective BBK, has 
the most evidence to support its use for these indications. 
Monitoring for BBK adverse effects, such as bradycardia, 
hypotension, congestive heart failure, and bronchospasm, is 
essential, as these effects could be detrimental in the acute 
period post-TBI. 
Disorders of Consciousness
Patients with disorders of consciousness have a prolonged 
altered consciousness that can be characterized as coma, 
vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome, or 
minimally conscious state based on their clinical exam. 
Following assessment and treatment of any confounding 
factors, amantadine (100–200 mg twice daily) is 
recommended for adults with vegetative state/unresponsive 
wakefulness syndrome or minimally conscious state (4–16 
weeks postinjury) to accelerate recovery and reduce 
disability.45,46 
Antibiotic Prophylaxis
Infection rates reported for patients undergoing ICP 
monitoring are highly variable. Rates are extremely low 
for intraparenchymal fiberoptic ICP monitors but may be 
significantly higher for EVDs. It is essential to develop and 
follow facility EVD and intraparenchymal bolt insertion and 
management protocols to decrease the risk of infectious
