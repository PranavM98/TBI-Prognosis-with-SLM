PATIENT MANAGEMENT

describe the predicted outcome probability as an “estimate 
only, subject to considerable uncertainty.” Experts in 
clinician-family communication recommend using language 
that brackets the range of possible patient outcomes by 
describing both the “best case” and “worst case,” as well 
as the “most likely,” scenarios as a way of expressing the 
uncertainty that is inherent in any prognostication.
Numerous studies including various neurocritical care 
conditions (e.g., intracerebral hemorrhage, global cerebral 
ischemia after cardiac arrest, and TBI) reported that 
worsened patient outcomes are associated with the 
reflexive default to early care limitations, including do-
not-resuscitate orders or withdrawal of life-sustaining 
therapies, independent of other patient characteristics.4–6 
Other studies found the ability to accurately and precisely 
prognosticate long-term outcome very early in a patient’s 
course after severe TBI is limited and frequently incorrect, 
especially in the first days after injury.7 Factors such as 
clinician perception of recovery likelihood and hospital-
specific practice patterns are sometimes implicated in the 
wide variability documented in early care limitations. These 
findings increase the concern that patients with severe TBI 
will have a “self-fulfilling prophecy” of poor outcomes when 
aggressive care is not provided.5,6,8 
Given these concerns, the best practice for patients 
with severe TBI is to provide a trial of aggressive therapy 
(e.g., surgical therapy, intensive care, and, if appropriate, 
placement of an intracranial monitor), if this treatment 
approach is consistent with patient and/or family goals of 
care. The previously advocated aggressive care minimum 
of 72 hours is arbitrary and not based in medical evidence. 
Recent studies reported the possibility of good outcomes 
in patients who remain unconscious for 4 or more weeks.1,9 
Exceptions include patients declared brain-dead, those with 
a preinjury advance directive indicating such interventions 
are not desired, and when families or surrogates wish to 
pursue comfort-based measures only. Thus, a longer period 
of treatment and observation is typically needed to increase 
certainty regarding prognosis for neurological recovery.10 
Age is often heavily weighted in prognostic decision-
making; however, do not use this factor in isolation or 
consider it as a valid singular reason for treatment-limiting 
decisions. Patient frailty, medical comorbidities, persistence 
of bilaterally unreactive pupils, and lack neurologic
