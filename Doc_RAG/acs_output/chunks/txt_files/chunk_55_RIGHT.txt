PATIENT MANAGEMENT
55
Specific anticoagulant reversal recommendations for 
patients with life-threatening bleeding (all etiologies) 
are published by the Neurocritical Care Society/Society 
of Critical Care Medicine, American Heart Association, 
and American Society of Hematology.20-22 Acute clinical 
management of TBI patients admitted on oral anticoagulant 
medications includes the following:
 
• Discontinuation of the anticoagulant 
 
• Determination of the DOAC type, dose, time of last dose 
 
• Determination of the impact of DOAC on surgical 
intervention and reversal strategies, when possible 
Laboratory assays are not readily available for DOAC-
specific quantitative measurements of anti-Xa activity or 
DOAC concentrations, nor is there a definitive therapeutic 
range for DOAC concentrations.23 More common clinical 
laboratory measurements that may be elevated if a DOAC 
was recently administered and have clinically relevant 
concentrations include the following: 
 
• An activated partial thromboplastin time in patients on 
dabigatran (thrombin inhibitor)
 
• Elevations of prothrombin time and activated partial 
thromboplastin time in patients on Xa inhibitors 
Normal values may not rule out potential therapeutic DOAC 
concentrations.20,22-24 
Note: Do not delay reversal therapy while waiting for 
laboratory results in emergent situations when the 
patient is at high risk for bleeding.
A medical history is very helpful to determine if 
comorbidities may increase DOAC concentration or prolong 
DOAC exposure (e.g., advanced age, renal dysfunction, 
renal failure or dialysis dependence, and drug interactions). 
TEG may be helpful for qualitative assessment of clot 
strength and fibrinolysis, but evidence is lacking for its 
use to support quantitative determination of therapeutic 
DOAC concentrations.23,25,26 Note: TEG results may not be 
accurate in patients receiving massive transfusion therapy. 
A summary of reversal strategies for oral anticoagulation 
agents can be found in Table 7.
