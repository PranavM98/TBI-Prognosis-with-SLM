day that passes without pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis, 
and VTE rates increase when trauma patients miss doses 
of pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis.3–5 A substantial body 
of evidence indicates that pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis 
reduces VTE rates in general trauma and TBI patients, and 
it may improve outcomes in TBI.6 Current best practice 
is to use mechanical prophylaxis on all TBI patients upon 
admission, regardless of their eligibility for pharmacologic 
prophylaxis.3
For patients with TBI, clinicians must balance concerns for 
progression of ICH with and without pharmacologic VTE 
prophylaxis against the known benefits of pharmacologic 
prophylaxis for reducing VTE risk. A general correlation 
of TBI severity with risk of ICH progression has been 
demonstrated.7,8 Individual patient factors may also affect 
risk of bleeding or thrombosis, such as congenital or 
acquired hypercoagulable or coagulopathic states, use of 
antithrombotic and anticoagulation medications, and acute 
injury patterns. The modified Berne-Norwood criteria and 
the Brain Injury Guidelines stratify risk of ICH progression 
based on mild, moderate, and severe injury patterns, with 
the Brain Injury Guidelines also accounting for several 
clinical factors (see Table 6).7,8 
• ICP monitor placement
• Craniotomy 
• Evidence of progression at 72 hrs
