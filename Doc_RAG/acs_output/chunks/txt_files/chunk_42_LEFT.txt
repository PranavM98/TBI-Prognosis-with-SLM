TRACHEOSTOMY
KEY POINT
 
• Consider all patients with severe TBI for early 
tracheostomy, within 7 days of injury, when rapid 
improvement is determined to be unlikely. 
 
• Early tracheostomy can decrease the risk of prolonged 
mechanical ventilation and pneumonia.
ICU patients with severe TBI often require prolonged 
mechanical ventilation for the following reasons: 
 
• Attenuated or loss of the pharyngeal protection reflex 
 
• Excessive secretions 
 
• Ventilator dyssynchrony 
 
• Impaired oxygen and CO2 exchange
 
• Severe agitation
 
• Severe associated injuries, including facial, airway, or 
thoracic injury
When the patient’s level of consciousness remains 
persistently depressed, consider performing a tracheostomy 
to have a patent airway and to decrease the ventilator-
associated risks of pneumonia and ventilator-induced lung 
injury. 
Early Tracheostomy
While no clear evidence exists for survival benefit, early 
tracheostomy is shown to reduce ICU and hospital LOS 
in patients with TBI. No absolute contraindications for 
tracheostomy exist, but relative contraindications include 
the following: uncontrolled intracranial hypertension, 
hemodynamic instability, and severe respiratory failure 
requiring high levels of FiO2 (> 50%) and PEEP (> 10 cm 
H2O).1 Additional benefits of tracheostomy for patients 
receiving prolonged mechanical ventilation include 
improved patient comfort associated with reduced 
oropharyngeal irritation and improved pulmonary hygiene. 
These factors might also accelerate liberation from 
mechanical ventilation.2 A recent study demonstrated 
tracheostomy rates in patients with severe TBI to be 
31.8%, with 41% of tracheostomies performed within 7 
days of injury and 26% performed more than 14 days after 
injury.3 This demonstrated substantial differences between 
participating centers regarding the timing of tracheostomy.3
