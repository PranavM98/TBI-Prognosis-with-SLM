MANAGEMENT OF PATIENTS WITH 
GLASGOW COMA SCALE (GCS) SCORE 
OF 13–15
KEY POINTS
 
• Although many patients with TBI and GCS 13–15 fully 
recover over a relatively short period, a sizeable subset 
have persistent symptoms that negatively impact their 
ADLs.
 
• It is estimated that TBI goes undetected and 
undiagnosed in an estimated 50% of patients presenting 
to the hospital ED with GCS 13–15 after injury.
 
• Integration of decision support tools and clinical 
practice guidelines into the standard clinical workflow is 
recommended to identify TBI in patients with GCS 13–15 
and to facilitate proper evaluation and treatment. 
 
• Follow the broader recommendations of this updated 
BPG for the acute management of patients with TBI 
having a GCS 13–15, including diagnostic testing, 
individualized treatment, discharge instruction, and 
outcome assessment. 
 
• Educate patients with GCS 13–15 about their injury 
and recommend outlets for follow-up care for those 
who experience persistent symptoms. Discuss timing 
of return to activities (e.g., work, school, and driving), 
and deliver individualized treatment to restore them to 
maximal functional capacity.
Incidence
Of the nearly 5 million patients seen in US hospital EDs 
annually with suspected TBI, approximately 90% have a 
GCS score of 13–15, or what has historically been classified 
as mild TBI.1,2 This level of injury is also representative of 
over 80% of all TBIs among US military service members,3,4 
and millions of athletes worldwide are affected each year 
by sport-related concussion.5 Practice guidelines and other 
helpful resources assist clinicians in the diagnosis and 
management of patients with TBI and GCS 13–15.6,7
