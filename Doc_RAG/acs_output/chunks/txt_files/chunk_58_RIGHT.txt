complications.47 Avoid the use of systemic antibiotic 
prophylaxis during parenchymal ICP monitor insertion 
and during the use of parenchymal or ventricular drains 
to reduce the risk for drug-resistant organisms.47,48 The 
most recent BTF and Neurocritical Care Society guidelines 
recommend the use of antimicrobial-impregnated 
catheters to prevent ventriculostomy-related infections 
during EVD monitoring, but these may not be available in 
every facility.47,49 A recent meta-analysis also suggested a 
substantial decrease in CSF infections (from 13.7% to 3.6%) 
when antimicrobial-impregnated catheters were used, as 
compared to a standard catheter group.50 Other strategies 
to reduce risk of infection include the following47:
 
• Remove ICP monitors and drains as early as clinically 
possible 
 
• Avoid routine EVD closed-system manipulation 
 
• Avoid CSF sampling unless clinically indicated
 
• Use aseptic technique 
Developing an EVD bundle with an insertion checklist, 
maintenance worksheet, dressing change procedure, and 
CSF sampling protocols and techniques is another strategy 
to reduce ventricular catheter-related infections.51
Avoid the use of antibiotic prophylaxis for traumatic 
skull-based fractures with CSF leaks or pneumocephalus 
due to the increased risk of promoting drug-resistant 
organism growth.52 In patients with open or penetrating 
skull fractures, consider treatment with broad-spectrum 
antibiotics with high blood-brain barrier penetration for a 
maximum of 3 days. Surgical debridement and irrigation are 
recommended as the standard of care, with perioperative 
antibiotics for not more than 24 hours. 
For surgical prophylaxis, cefazolin is the drug of choice 
for patients without methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus 
aureus, unless the patient has a documented severe beta 
lactam allergy. Clindamycin or vancomycin are appropriate 
alternatives for those with a severe allergy to beta lactams. 
Clarify any antibiotic allergy preoperatively, when possible, 
given the superiority of cefazolin to the alternative options. 
Select the antimicrobial agent and dosing using published 
guidelines, in conjunction with pharmacist consultation, to 
optimize therapy.
