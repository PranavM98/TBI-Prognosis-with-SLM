extubation fails or is not possible due to the absence 
of safety criteria, the need for tracheostomy must be 
evaluated.
Older Adult Considerations
As a general rule, the decision-making and management of 
mechanical ventilation in an older adult with severe TBI is 
the same as for a younger patient. Consider an individual 
patientâ€™s goals of care when making decisions about the 
provision of invasive support. Although hypoxia is clearly 
detrimental to patients of any age with severe TBI, the use 
of mechanical ventilation to tightly control CO2 may not 
be as important in a patient with cerebral atrophy and a 
relatively lower risk of intracranial hypertension. However, 
older adult patients may have baseline oropharyngeal 
dysfunction making early intubation following TBI even 
more appropriate. Endotracheal intubation and mechanical 
ventilation in older patients carry the same risks as in 
younger patients.
Pediatric Considerations
No pediatric-specific literature or guidelines on mechanical 
ventilation after TBI have been published. A cuffed 
endotracheal tube is favored for children with TBI who 
require intubation, in order to facilitate optimal ventilation 
strategies and minimize risk of aspiration. Overall, the 
general physiologic considerations motivating ventilation 
management for children with TBI are similar to those for 
adults.
