decisions regarding use of mechanical and pharmacologic 
VTE prophylaxis. General risk factors include older age, 
higher injury severity score, lower GCS, blood transfusion, 
prolonged central venous catheter use, and major 
surgery.23–25 Considering these factors, recommendations 
include: 
 
• Hospitals need to adopt a published VTE risk 
assessment tool (e.g., ROCKIT) for pediatric trauma 
patients, and VTE risk stratification needs to be 
performed following admission.26
 
• Children at low risk do not require pharmacologic VTE 
prophylaxis.
 
• Children at moderate risk need to have mechanical VTE 
prophylaxis initiated at admission. 
 
• Reserve pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis for patients 
considered at high risk for VTE.
 
• Pediatric contraindications to pharmacologic VTE 
prophylaxis are the same as for adults (regarding 
presence of ICH, risk of ICH progression, and recent 
surgery).
 
• LMWH is the preferred agent for pharmacologic VTE 
prophylaxis in the pediatric population. Use weight-
based dosing in young children.
 
• While duration of VTE prophylaxis is not well studied, 
discontinue VTE prophylaxis when the patient is 
ambulatory in the absence of other thrombogenic 
factors.
