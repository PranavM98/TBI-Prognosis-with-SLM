Pediatric Considerations
Pediatric patients with presumed clinically important 
injuries are, ideally, transported to a pediatric trauma 
center or other trauma center with pediatric capabilities. 
Transfer to pediatric trauma centers may be unnecessary 
for a subset of pediatric patients with the following low-risk 
injuries:
 
• Low-energy blunt trauma
 
• No concern for nonaccidental mechanism
 
• Low risk based on pediatric minor head injury computed 
tomography (CT) guidelines published by the Pediatric 
Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN)4
 
• Negative imaging
 
• Imaging with isolated, nondisplaced skull fractures 
without other intracranial injuries
Note: The development of pediatric-specific 
guidelines is a vital component of pediatric 
care. For additional guidance on pediatric 
prehospital and interfacility tool kits, visit the 
website of the United States Health Resources 
and Services Administration (HRSA) Emergency 
Medical Services for Children program: https://
