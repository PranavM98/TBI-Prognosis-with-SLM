The GCS sum score is often used to stratify degrees of 
brain injury: a sum score ≥ 13 correlates with mild injury, a 
sum score 9–12 is consistent with moderate injury, and a 
sum score ≤ 8 is indicative of severe brain injury. Caution: 
Recognize that injury severity classification using only 
the GCS sum score represents  an overly simplistic and 
unidimensional approximation of injury load.
