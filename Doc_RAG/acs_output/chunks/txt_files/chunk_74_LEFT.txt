Prognosis and Outcome 
Common symptoms in patients with TBI and GCS 13–15 
include headache, dizziness, visuo-oculomotor difficulties, 
cognitive dysfunction, sleep problems, sensory dysfunction, 
psychological health problems, and others. Typically, 
symptoms are most severe acutely (within the first few 
days) and improve gradually over time. A significant 
percentage of patients achieve full recovery within a 
relatively short period (days to weeks), but at least half 
experience persistent cognitive, somatic, and psychological 
symptoms that negatively impact their normal life activities 
for months or years after injury.12,13 Approximately 50% of 
patients diagnosed with TBI and GCS 13–15 evaluated in the 
ED do not attain full recovery by 12 months after injury.12 
Combinations of injury (e.g., acute injury severity, pathology 
on CT, etc.) and noninjury factors (e.g., premorbid 
psychiatric history, neurologic vulnerability, social distress, 
etc.) are known to increase risk of prolonged recovery and/
or poor functional outcome in these patients. 
Follow-Up Care 
Provide patients with educational resources about their 
injury, expected recovery, and outlets for follow-up care. 
Patients who experience persistent symptoms or difficulties 
(i.e., longer than 2 weeks postinjury) may need more 
specific evaluation and treatment targeting their specific
