EXTRACRANIAL BLUNT 
CEREBROVASCULAR INJURY
KEY POINTS
 
• When a blunt cerebrovascular injury (BCVI) is found, 
initiate treatment with anticoagulation or antiplatelet 
agents as soon as the TBI is stable, ideally within the first 
24 hours.
 
• Spine fractures are the single most predictive factor of 
BCVI, with greatest risk to the vertebral artery.
 
• Perform liberal screening in older adult patients with risk 
factors for BCVI, because BCVI in geriatric patients is an 
independent risk factor for mortality.
Extracranial BCVI has a reported incidence of 2.7% to 7.6% 
among patients who had CT angiography following blunt 
force trauma.1,2 Undetected carotid and vertebral artery 
injury can lead to delayed therapy and increase the patient’s 
risk of stroke. Patients at high risk of stroke can present with 
both carotid and vertebral artery injury. Untreated carotid 
and vertebral artery injuries have a mortality as high as 38% 
and 18%, respectively.3,4 Both Denver and Memphis trauma 
groups have recommended criteria to screen for BCVI (see 
Box 5).
Spine fractures are the single most predictive factor of 
BCVI, with greatest risk to the vertebral artery.3,5,11–13 Older 
adult patients with low-energy injury mechanisms, including 
ground-level falls, are also at risk for BCVI.14 Radiographic 
screening for BCVI with CT angiography is a sufficient and 
cost-effective modality, and it is the recommended means 
of excluding this injury.15–17 However, for questionable 
injuries or those that may be amenable to endovascular 
treatment, formal angiography may be performed.
Even with strict adherence to the Denver and Memphis 
screening criteria, 20% to 30% of BCVIs are missed.1,2,18,19 
Several studies now recommend universal screening for 
all patients with major trauma using a whole-body CT 
(WBCT) scan.1,2,18 The WBCT includes a non-contrast CT 
of the head followed by a multi-slice (40- or 64-slice) CT 
scan incorporating a single IV contrast-enhanced pass from 
the circle of Willis through the pelvis. This imaging allows 
screening for BCVI while evaluating the cervical spine,
