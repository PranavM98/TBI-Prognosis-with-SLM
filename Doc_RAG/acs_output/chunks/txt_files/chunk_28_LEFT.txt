Tier One treatment of
intracranial hypertension
 
• Reexamine the patient and consider repeating CT 

to reevaluate intracranial pathology
 
• Reconsider surgical options for potentially surgical

lesions
 
• Consider extracranial causes of ICP elevation (e.g., 
intrathoracic or intra-abdominal pressure)
Tier Two treatment of
intracranial hypertension
 
• Review basic physiologic parameters to confirm they 
are in the desired range (e.g., CPP, blood gas values, 
etc.)

Tier Three treatment of
intracranial hypertension

Traumatic Brain Injury Consensus Conference (SIBICC). Intensive Care Med. 2019 Dec;45(12):1783–1794. doi: 10.1007/s00134-019-05805-9. Used with

concentration at 0.5 mL/kg (up to 30 mL) over 10 to 20 
minutes. Less evidence supports the use of mannitol.7 
Additionally, a lower hypoventilation target of 28 to 34 
mm Hg is recommended in the Tier Two interventions.7 
Moderate prophylactic hypothermia (32–33°C) is not 
recommended over normothermia to improve overall 
outcomes, but it is suggested for ICP control.6,7
