The tiered approach provides structure while retaining 
medical decision-making within tiers. The variety of 
treatments within each tier also supports targeting 
interventions at specific physiological disruptions (targeted 
therapy). See Box 2 for Tier Zero treatment algorithms. 
See Box 3 for the ICP treatment algorithms for Tiers One, 
Two, and Three. Full descriptions of the SIBICC I protocol 
(ICP monitoring)2 and SIBICC II protocol (ICP plus PbtO2 
monitoring)1 are open access.
Box 2. Tier Zero—Basic ICU Care Interventions—SIBICC I 
Algorithm
Expected Interventions:
 
• Admission to ICU
 
• Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation
 
• Serial evaluations of neurological status and 
pupillary reactivity
 
• Elevate head of bed 30–45° 
 
• Analgesia to manage signs of pain (not ICP directed)
 
• Sedation to prevent agitation, ventilator asynchrony, 
etc. (not ICP directed)
 
• Temperature management to prevent fever 
 
• Measure core temperature
 
• Treat core temperature above 38.0°C
 
• Consider prophylactic anti-seizure medications for 

1 week only (in the absence of indication to 
continue)
 
• Maintain CPP initially ≥ 60 mm Hg
 
• Maintain hemoglobin > 7 g/dL
 
• Avoid hyponatremia
 
• Optimize venous return from head (e.g., keep head 
midline, ensure cervical collars are not too tight)
 
• Arterial line for continuous blood pressure 
monitoring
 
• Maintain SpO2 ≥ 94%
Recommended Interventions:
 
• Insertion of a central line
 
• End-tidal CO2 monitoring
