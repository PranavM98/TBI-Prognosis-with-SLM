Decompressive Craniectomy
Decompressive craniectomy, in which after performing 
a large frontotemporoparietal craniotomy the bone flap 
is not replaced, has recently increased in popularity. Two 
indications for decompressive craniectomy exist in the 
context of trauma.
Primary decompressive craniectomy: This procedure 
involves leaving the bone flap out following acute 
evacuation of a mass lesion (typically an acute SDH). In 
the presence of brain swelling, a primary decompressive 
craniectomy is recommended following evacuation of the 
mass lesion. However, the bone flap may be replaced if the 
underlying brain is not compressed and other factors are 
considered (e.g., burden of concomitant brain injuries, other 
extracranial injuries, availability of ICP monitoring, and ICU 
facilities). See Figure 3.2
