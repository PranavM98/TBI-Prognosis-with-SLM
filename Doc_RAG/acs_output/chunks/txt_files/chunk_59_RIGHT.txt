Antibiotic prophylaxis: Pediatric-specific data are limited 
regarding the use of antimicrobial prophylaxis outside of the 
perioperative period of EVD placement. Extrapolation of the 
adult data outlined above and previous studies in similar 
settings (e.g., hydrocephalus, ventriculoperitoneal shunt 
failure) support only the use of perioperative antimicrobials.
