BCVI Management
Management of BCVI is principally focused on mitigating 
the risk of thromboembolism, which would result in 
ischemic stroke.9,22,23 Treatment options include the use 
of antiplatelet agents, anticoagulants, and endovascular 
therapy. Large observational studies identified that 
treatment with any antithrombotic medication appears to 
be associated with lower risk of stroke than no treatment, 
although this has not been tested in large randomized 
trials.4,22 Trials of patients with cervical arterial dissection, 
including but not primarily focused on BCVI patients, have 
found that antiplatelet therapy and anticoagulation with 
warfarin (usually with bridging IV heparin until INR is 
therapeutic) generally perform in a similar manner, although 
a slight benefit to warfarin may exist.24–26 
When a BCVI is found, current best practice is to initiate 
treatment with anticoagulation or antiplatelet agents as 
soon as the TBI is stable, ideally within the first 24 hours for 
patients who are not at a high risk for TBI progression and in 
whom bleeding from extracranial injuries is controlled.23,27–30 
This recommendation is reasonable for patients who 
have experienced symptoms from cerebral ischemia (e.g., 
transient ischemic attack or infarction) and for patients 
asymptomatic from their extracranial BCVI. Remaining 
questions include, is dual antiplatelet therapy preferred over 
aspirin alone, and do high-risk features such as intraluminal 
thrombus or BCVI grade warrant anticoagulation over 
antiplatelet therapy? Information on the use of direct-acting 
oral anticoagulants as an alternative to warfarin is limited. 
Generally, treatment with antithrombotic agents continues 
for at least 3 months.26 Follow-up noninvasive imaging 
with CT angiography or MRI at 3 months is reasonable 
to assess healing.26 Consider reserving endovascular 
therapy with stenting or coil embolization for nonhealing 
pseudoaneurysms or recurrent cerebral ischemic events 
despite antithrombotic therapy.29 Primary endovascular 
embolization/sacrifice of an artery affected by BCVI is often 
not recommended as an initial strategy. This is because of 
the risk of periprocedural complications29 and the natural 
history of healing for many lesions, as long as the patient 
is protected from thromboembolic events by some form 
of antithrombotic therapy. However, depending upon the 
involved vessel and injury grade and configuration, stenting
