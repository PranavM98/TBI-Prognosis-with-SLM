PATIENT MANAGEMENT

of PaCO2 to less than 30 mm Hg may be justified as a 
temporizing measure while other interventions (including 
surgery) are put in place. However, consider such profound 
hyperventilation to be a rescue procedure and use it for as 
short a period as possible, because it can result in arterial 
spasm and decreased CBF.1 The PaCO2 levels indicated here 
may be detected by continuous end-tidal CO2 monitoring, 
while recognizing that arterial end-tidal CO2 gradients 
vary between patients and individuals over time. In most 
instances, moderate levels of positive end-expiratory 
pressure (PEEP) of < 10 cm H2O will not elevate ICP further 
in the presence of intracranial hypertension. It can be safely 
applied to maintain oxygenation when accompanied by ICP 
monitoring.2 
Rescue therapies for severe/refractory ventilatory failure, 
such as prone positioning, neuromuscular blockers, and 
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), have 
not been systematically studied in the context of TBI. 
Apply them cautiously and on an individual basis, because 
monitoring and controlling their effect on intracranial 
volumes and intracranial bleeding is mandatory.
ECMO is increasingly utilized in severe polytrauma 
patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. 
Compared to venoatrial ECMO, venovenous ECMO without 
anticoagulation was shown to have a survival benefit 
in the selected, monitored cases where the patient’s 
systemic oxygenation was unresponsive to conventional 
management.3 
Extubation Planning
Tracheal extubation remains challenging.4 The probability of 
extubation success increases in the following conditions:
 
• GCS motor score of 6 
 
• Normal respiratory drive 
 
• Stable intracranial conditions 
 
• Intact airway protective reflexes (vigorous cough, gag 
reflex, and swallowing attempts)
 
• Endotracheal suctioning ≤ 2 times per hour
The difficulty with uniformly predicting successful tracheal 
extubation for patients with TBI means that tracheal 
extubation may be attempted in some patients while 
accepting that reintubation may be needed. If tracheal
