Hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia may each have 
detrimental effects on patient outcomes. Closely monitor 
serum glucose levels, with a target range of 100–180 mg/
dL. More frequent monitoring may be appropriate upon 
initiation of nutritional support, particularly in patients with 
confirmed or suspected diabetes mellitus.
Hematology Monitoring
Hematology monitoring is essential in patients with TBI. 
Although recommendations for hemoglobin transfusion 
thresholds vary somewhat, the current literature and expert 
consensus suggest a transfusion threshold of ≥ 7 g/dL.3,4
Early evaluation for coagulopathy is important for 
patients with TBI. Assessment of direct and indirect 
coagulation cascades using INR is essential (a target 
INR ≤ 1.4 is appropriate in most cases). Utilization of 
thromboelastography (TEG), rotational thromboelastometry 
(ROTEM), and platelet function assays may provide 
additional information regarding the need for targeted 
therapy to reverse coagulopathy.
