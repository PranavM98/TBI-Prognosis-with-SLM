TIMING OF PHARMACOLOGIC VENOUS 
THROMBOEMBOLISM PROPHYLAXIS
KEY POINTS
 
• Venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis is 
recommended within 24 hours after injury in patients 
with low-risk nonoperative TBI, provided the follow-up 
CT shows no progression of intracranial injury.
 
• VTE prophylaxis is recommended within 24 to 48 hours 
after injury in patients with moderate- or high-risk 
nonoperative TBI, provided the follow-up head CT shows 
no progression of intracranial injury.
 
• In patients who have undergone craniotomy 
or craniectomy, consider initiating or resuming 
pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis within 24 to 48 hours 
after surgery if ICH is stable on postoperative CT.
 
• Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is preferred 
over unfractionated heparin (UFH) for prophylaxis in TBI 
patients.
Trauma patients, particularly those with polytrauma 
or severe injury patterns, have a significant risk of 
VTE. Patients with TBI have a high risk of VTE without 
prophylaxis or when receiving only mechanical 
prophylaxis.1,2 Providing pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis 
for trauma patients with significant injuries is standard 
practice.1–3 VTE risk increases for patients with TBI for each
