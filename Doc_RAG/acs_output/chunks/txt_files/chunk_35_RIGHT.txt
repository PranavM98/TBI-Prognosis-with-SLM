PATIENT MANAGEMENT
35
Depressed skull fractures: Depressed skull fractures are 
commonly surgically elevated if the depression is greater 
than the thickness of the adjacent skull, especially if located 
in a cosmetically important area like the forehead. Open 
depressed skull fractures are usually treated surgically to 
prevent infection. However, nonoperative management may 
be attempted in selected cases, limited to those without 
dural laceration, gross contamination, evidence of infection, 
or injury to the frontal sinus. In most cases, depressed skull 
fractures over a dural venous sinus are not treated surgically 
because of the high risk for uncontrollable hemorrhage.
