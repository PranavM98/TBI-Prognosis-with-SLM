Older Adult Considerations
Increasing age and age-related neurodegenerative disease 
(e.g., Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias) are 
associated with higher baseline levels of brain injury 
biomarkers, including GFAP and UCH-L1.15-17 This results 
in a smaller range within which acute brain injury may 
be discriminated. It raises the possibility that age- and/
or comorbidity-specific cutoff values may be useful 
for reducing unnecessary head CTs in older adults, as 
demonstrated for S100B (measured within 3 hours of 
injury).17 Several large cohort studies investigated sensitivity 
and specificity of plasma GFAP and UCH-L1 assays, and/
or S100B assays, in older adult TBI.17-19 Studies pertaining to 
FDA-approved GFAP and UCH-L1 assays are summarized in 
Table 3.17,19
