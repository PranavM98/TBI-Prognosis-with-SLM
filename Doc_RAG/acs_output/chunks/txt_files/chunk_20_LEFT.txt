GOALS OF DIRECTED CARE
KEY POINT
 
• Ideally, it is recommended to keep clinical parameters 
within normal physiologic ranges for patients with 
TBI, after considering potential risks and benefits of 
intervention.
A cornerstone of effective goal-directed treatment for 
TBI is aiming to maintain clinical parameters within 
normal physiological ranges. Some of these parameters 
are more relevant for patients in the ICU setting—such 
as cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), ICP, and partial 
brain tissue oxygenation (PbtO2)—while others, such as 
oxygen saturation (SpO2), are applicable to all patients. 
Interventions to achieve desired parameters are best 
provided within the overall context of the patient’s 
condition. When achieving clinical parameter goals require 
intensive therapy, carefully consider the potential risks 
and benefits of each intervention. The recommended 
parameters for goal-directed treatment in Table 4 represent 
ideal ranges rather than mandatory, at-all-costs goals for all 
scenarios.
