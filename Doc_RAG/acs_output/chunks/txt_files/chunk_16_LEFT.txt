injury, peaks at about 20 hours postinjury, and decreases 
subsequently. Prospective observational data from at least 
three large, multicenter studies (representing > 6,000 
patients in the US and Europe) demonstrated that the 
combination of day-of-injury GFAP and UCH-L1 values 
have an excellent negative predictive value for ruling out 
traumatic ICH (see Table 2).7-10

For the FDA-approved iSTAT assay, GFAP values less than 
30 pg/mL and UCH-L1 values less than 360 pg/mL are 
considered not elevated, ruling out the need for a brain CT. 
If either biomarker exceeds its cutoff value (i.e., an elevated 
test), a brain CT is indicated. However, an elevated test 
does not definitively indicate a brain CT will be positive. A 
brain CT may be negative even in cases where structural 
brain injury is present, as some injuries might only be 
detectable on a brain MRI.11 Current FDA clearance requires 
measurement of these biomarkers on whole blood within 24 
hours of injury. GFAP levels also add incremental diagnostic 
information to existing head CT decision rules that leverage 
clinical data.10
Biomarkers and Functional Recovery
Biomarker blood levels can inform the prediction of a 
patient’s functional recovery.12-14 Higher biomarker levels 
are associated with worse structural brain injury and 
portend a worse prognosis. One study compared patients 
with day-of-injury iSTAT GFAP values < 1200 pg/mL to 
those with values > 12,000 pg/mL; patients with values 
> 12,000 pg/mL had a 6.98 times higher risk of mortality 
within 6 months.12 Similarly, patients with day-of-injury 
iSTAT UCH-L1 values > 2000 pg/mL were reported to have
