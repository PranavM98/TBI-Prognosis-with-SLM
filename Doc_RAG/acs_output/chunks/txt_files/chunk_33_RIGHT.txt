PATIENT MANAGEMENT
33
craniotomy bone flap (≈ 12 × 15 cm) is created to effectively 
visualize sources of hemorrhage in the parasagittal, parieto-
occipital, and temporo-basal regions.1 This also maximizes 
the opportunity for primary and secondary decompression. 
The 15 cm recommendation may be excessive in some 
patients with smaller heads. Note that a bone flap of at 
least 13 cm in the vertical plane provides the opportunity for 
optimal decompression of the middle fossa. Additional bony 
removal in the subtemporal region and the sphenoid wing 
can be considered to augment exposure and decompression 
(see Figure 2). No role exists for attempted burr hole 
drainage of solid clots.

A large frontotemporoparietal craniotomy provides optimal 
visualization of the bleeding source and an opportunity 
for primary or secondary decompression. A large reverse 
question mark incision is made starting 1 cm anterior to 
the tragus at the root of the zygoma, coursing just superior 
to the pinna and extending posteriorly over the parietal 
bossing, then carried forward linearly to the hairline while 
staying 1.5–2 cm lateral to midline. The myocutaneous 
flap is reflected to expose the keyhole and the root of the 
zygoma. Burr holes are placed to enable a large craniotomy 
for decompression of the anterior and middle fossa floor.
