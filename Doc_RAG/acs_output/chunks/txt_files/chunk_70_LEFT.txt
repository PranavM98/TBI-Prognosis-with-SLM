Patients with high risk require family education regarding 
PTE signs and symptoms, diagnostic vigilance for its 
detection, and long-term follow-up after TBI by qualified 
professionals.13
Impact of PTE on Outcome 
It remains unclear whether patients with PTE have worse 
mortality and functional outcomes or if patient outcomes 
are primarily related to their injury severity (which also 
correlates with PTE development). Some recent studies 
demonstrated patient outcome effects related to PTE.
In a large prospective cohort study controlling for age, 
presenting GCS, and imaging findings, patients with 
PTE demonstrated significantly lower GOS-E scores and 
performed worse than controls on both the Rivermead 
Cognitive Metrics and Brief Symptom Inventory-18 scores.14 
This study relied upon a National Institutes of Health 
stroke-related epilepsy screening tool to identify self-
diagnosed seizures. The incidence of self-reported seizures 
in the TBI group was consistent with prior published 
reports, and the two control groups had no self-reported 
seizures, arguing for the reliability of this screening tool 
for the TBI population. Importantly, the study identified 
a correlation between self-reported seizures and poor 
functional outcomes, as well as persistent posttraumatic 
symptoms.14 Other studies have reported higher mortality in 
patients with TBI and PTE compared to TBI patients without 
PTE when controlling for other factors.4,15,16 This emerging 
evidence suggests that the presence of PTE confers 
additional morbidity and mortality to survivors of TBI.
Treatment Strategies
A discussion regarding the choice and duration of ASM 
therapy is beyond the scope of this BPG. Initiate treatment 
for patients experiencing a first late seizure after TBI. Refer 
the patient to a clinician with appropriate expertise in the 
management of PTE, because the likelihood of developing 
recurrent seizures after the first is as high as 86% by 2 
years postinjury.8 The choice and duration of ASM therapy 
for those with PTE must be tailored to individual patient 
characteristics, including but not limited to seizure control, 
side effects, and options for other types of treatment (e.g., 
dietary modifications, neuromodulation, or other surgical 
approaches).
