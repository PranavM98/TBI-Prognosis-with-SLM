cognitive impairment, infection, depressive symptoms), 
delayed mobilization, increased LOS, and readmission.25 
Management includes screening and ongoing nutritional 
status monitoring.26 The Mini Nutritional Assessment is the 
most widely used screening tool (https://www.mna-elderly.
com/sites/default/files/2021-10/mna-mini-english.pdf).27,28 
The Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index is another nutritional 
assessment based on serum albumin levels and body mass 
index.29–31 
The aims of nutritional intervention include the following:
 
• Replenishment of protein and energy stores 
 
• Maintenance of functional capacity 
 
• Reduction of malnutrition-associated costs (e.g., LOS, 
subacute care, and quality of life)32 
Dysphagia increases the risk of aspiration and 
malnutrition.32 The primary risk factor for dysphagia is 
mechanical ventilation, leading to further complications.33 
Screening entails volume-viscosity swallow testing that can 
be administered at the bedside.34 
Pediatric Considerations
Nutrition therapies for pediatric patients with severe TBI 
must take into account hydration and electrolyte goals to 
prevent fluid shifts that could worsen cerebral edema. 
Equations for predicting energy expenditure may 
overestimate requirements in severe TBI. Neuroprotective 
interventions in contemporary TBI management 
(e.g., sedation, neuromuscular blockade, effective 
thermoregulation, and seizure control) may depress 
energy expenditure, potentially even below predicted basal 
levels.35–37
Pediatric-specific data support the following nutrition 
recommendations consistent with adults:
 
• Initiate EN support once a patient is hemodynamically 
stable, ideally within 24 to 72 hours of injury.38,39
 
• Attempt to achieve full nutritional supplementation 
within 7 days of injury.38
 
• Gastric or postpyloric access are viable modes of EN, 
although more patients achieve caloric goals with 
postpyloric feeds, without a difference in symptoms of 
feeding intolerance.40
 
• In patients for whom EN is contraindicated, consider PN 
support.
