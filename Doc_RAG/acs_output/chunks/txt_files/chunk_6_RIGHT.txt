ASSESSMENT
6
Closely monitor patients in the prehospital setting with 
appropriate equipment to assess blood pressure, pulse 
oximetry, end-tidal CO2, and temperature. Perform frequent 
serial assessments of the GCS, and note changes. It is 
important to document and communicate the individual 
components of the GCS, especially the motor score.
Providing initial resuscitative care in hospitals without 
neurosurgical care may occasionally be rationalized in 
rural settings with long transport times. However, these 
hospitals need predefined air/ground transfer protocols and 
agreements in place to provide for the immediate transfer 
of patients to a center that has the continuous availability 
of resources and expertise to care for all aspects of TBI. 
This is critical for patients with an abnormal neurological 
exam, displaced skull fracture, or significant intracranial 
injury such as a large subdural hematoma (SDH), epidural 
hematoma (EDH), intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH), or 
intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH).
Older Adult Considerations 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 
recommends that injured older adults be triaged to 
trauma centers when possible. Factors that can affect 
prehospital triage accuracy with older adults include the 
following: major trauma resulting from low-energy impact 
mechanisms (low-level falls) not captured by the current 
triage tools, polypharmacy, age-related physiological 
responses to injuries, frailty, and anticoagulant and 
antiplatelet medication use. Comorbidities that may also 
be factors in prehospital triage accuracy include dementia, 
cerebral atrophy permitting accumulation of (initially) 
asymptomatic traumatic hemorrhage, co-occurring stroke 
or syncope (which may have preceded head trauma), and 
presence of other chronic organ insufficiencies.2,3
