a 22.38 times higher risk of mortality within 6 months, 
compared to patients with day-of-injury iSTAT UCH-L1 
values < 360 pg/mL.12 The majority of these patient deaths 
occurred during the first month postinjury. Among patients 
with GCS 3–12 TBI, these biomarkers also have a high 
discriminative ability for distinguishing between patients 
more likely to function independently outside the home 
(Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended [GOS-E] > 4) versus 
those who are not (C-statistic 0.89; 95% confidence 
interval [CI] 0.86–0.91).12
Note: These biomarkers alone do not predict 
functional recovery in GCS 13–15 TBI with sufficient 
accuracy. However, GCS 15 patients with significantly 
elevated GFAP and/or UCH-L1 levels are at risk for 
protracted recovery and warrant referral to a brain 
injury/concussion clinic for further management. 
Patients with nonelevated GFAP and UCH-L1 values 
may also be at risk for protracted recovery, though 
their risk is much lower than patients with elevated 
GFAP and/or UCH-L1. Therefore, counsel these 
patients with recommendations to seek care if they 
have persistent symptoms.
