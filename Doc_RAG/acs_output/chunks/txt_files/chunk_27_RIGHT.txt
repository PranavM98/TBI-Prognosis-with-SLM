PATIENT MANAGEMENT

Inter-Tier Recommendations
An ancillary value of the tiered structure is that the tiers 
act as a proxy for treatment resistance (i.e., disease 
severity). The SIBICC working group formulated inter-
tier recommendations to be considered when advancing 
between tiers (see Figure 1). These recommendations 
are directed at ensuring that the baseline management 
parameters remain acceptable, that judgment calls 
(e.g., operability of cerebral contusions) do not need 
reassessment, and that treatable outside influences of 
ICP are not involved (e.g., intrathoracic or intra-abdominal 
pressures). This is also a good time to consider consultation 
or transfer, if such resources are available.
Older Adult Considerations
For ICP management in older adults, evaluate 
pharmacotherapeutic strategies for dosage adjustments 
to prevent toxicity and prolonged duration of action. 
Increased concentrations of active drugs may result from 
older adults’ physiologic responses, including decreases in 
volume distribution, protein binding with hypoalbuminemia, 
hepatic metabolism, and renal function. Comorbidities 
and preexisting conditions, such as dementia or stroke, as 
well as adverse effects of medication make the diagnosis 
and treatment goals more challenging as well. Older 
adult patients may also have slower recovery trajectories 
and worse outcomes, which can be mitigated through 
aggressive treatment and good preinjury health status.3–5
Pediatric Considerations
In 2019, the consensus guideline to manage severe TBI 
injury for children was updated by an interdisciplinary 
team.6 An accompanying algorithm of tiered therapy was 
included, similar to that of SIBICC, although condensed 
into two tiers.7 Minor variations in the tier classifications 
do not indicate evidence-based discrepancies. Note: 
These guidelines predate results from the Approaches and 
Decisions in Acute Pediatric TBI Trial (ADAPT).8
In a few instances, available evidence supports different 
approaches to the care of children with severe TBI. For 
example, evidence supports the use of hypertonic 3% 
saline boluses, either 2 to 5 mL/kg over 10 to 20 min 
or at a constant rate of 0.1–1 mL/kg/hour, or a 23.4%
