IMPLEMENTATION AND INTEGRATION OF THE BEST PRACTICES GUIDELINES
Performance Improvement Recommendations
Outcome Measure and Threshold
Monitoring to maintain optimal ICP goals
Refer to Table 4 on page 20: Goals of Treatment Recommended 
Parameters
Monitoring to maintain optimal CPP goal of 60–70 mm Hg
Refer to Table 4 on page 20: Goals of Treatment Recommended 
Parameters
Timeliness of ICP monitoring in TBI GCS ≤ 8
Recommended in comatose patients (GCS ≤ 8) if evidence of structural 
brain damage is seen on initial CT imaging, or polytrauma patients and in 
patients going to the operating room for acute injuries when clinical exam 
is limited 
ICP monitoring in TBI GCS > 8
Recommended in patients with structural brain damage with high risk for 
progression (e.g., large/multiple contusions) and in cases when knowing 
ICP might facilitate management of other issues (e.g., earlier extracranial 
surgery)
Monitoring treatment of brain tissue hypoxia 
Maintain PbtO2 ≥ 15 mm Hg
Timely utilization of continuous EEG monitoring for seizure 
detection and management 
Per individual facility
Surgical management
Time to operative intervention (may vary depending on resources)
Craniotomy < 4 hours after arrival for patients with operative 
indication, excluding ICP monitoring 
Ensure delayed craniotomy rates are monitored within the PI program
 
Early enteral (or parental) nutrition support to attain caloric 
replacement
Nutritional support is initiated within 3 days
Guidelines include alternate feeding method when EN is 
contraindicated
PN support is recommended when EN is contraindicated
Documented guidelines to identify TBI patients at elevated risk 
for nutrition deficiency
Guidelines for specific populations could include pediatric, geriatric, and 
patients with impaired mobility
Measures to prevent skin breakdown with nutrition plan and 
protection barrier
Assessment and interventions are documented
Monitoring of electrolytes
Glucose and sodium are monitored
Early mobilization or simple interventions (such as passive 
movement and splinting) are an integral part of rehabilitation 
These elements are implemented within the first 48 hours of injury
Timely endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation 
Indicated in TBI when patient has
 
• Reduced consciousness, GCS < 9
 
• Severe agitation
 
• Loss of airway protective reflexes 
Early endotracheal intubation may be indicated in patients with GCS > 8, 
particularly in the presence of thoracic and abdominal injuries 
 
• Optimal target range of PaO2 is 80–100 mm Hg 
Monitoring to maintain normoxia and normocapnia, including 
continuous endotracheal CO2 monitoring
 
• Optimal target range of PaCO2 without ICP elevation is 35–45 mm Hg
Timely tracheostomy placement 
Consider within 7 days of injury 
Extracranial BCVI imaging
Consider use of CT angiography to detect potential vertebral artery injury
Extracranial BCVI management and follow-up
Antithrombotic therapy and referral for follow-up are provided at 
discharge, if warranted
Initiation of anticoagulation or antiplatelet agents when no 
contraindications exist
Therapy may begin as early as 24 hours postinjury
