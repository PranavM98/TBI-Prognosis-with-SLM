PATIENT MANAGEMENT
51
LMWH is considered superior to UFH for VTE prophylaxis 
in trauma patients without TBI,1,3 and LMWH is the 
preferred agent for TBI patients, including those with ICP 
monitors.3,16–21 Current evidence suggests that LMWH 
is associated with lower VTE rates and comparable ICH 
progression rates when compared to UFH, in both operative 
and nonoperative TBI patients.16–21 Current best practice 
dosing for enoxaparin in general trauma patients is 40 
mg every 12 hours.1 Because of insufficient and specific 
research of this dosing regimen in patients with TBI, an 
initial regimen of 30 mg every 12 hours is recommended 
for patients with TBI. If using dalteparin, standard dosing is 
recommended. Additionally, consider monitoring anti-factor 
Xa activity levels to guide subsequent LMWH dosing.1–3,22 
If UFH is chosen for pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis, 
best practice is to dose at 5000 units every 8 hours. 
Use of prophylactic inferior vena cava filters is no longer 
recommended, regardless of the timing of pharmacologic 
VTE prophylaxis in TBI patients. The indication for inferior 
vena cava filter placement is the presence of a known 
VTE in a patient with contraindication for therapeutic 
anticoagulation.3 
Monitoring local experience for performance improvement 
(PI) opportunities is beneficial. PI metrics to consider 
include:
 
• Time to initiation of pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis
 
• Pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis agent used
 
• Delayed craniotomy/craniectomy rate
Older Adult Considerations
Pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis management in the 
geriatric population is the same as described for other 
adults. Keep in mind that altered renal function may affect 
LMWH dosing or prompt the use of UFH.
Pediatric Considerations
VTE in pediatric trauma patients is very rare in comparison 
to adult populations. Age is an important VTE risk factor 
in children; estimates show VTE incidence of 0.09% in 
patients ages 0–12 years, 0.27% in patients ages 13–15 
years, and 0.73% in patients ages 16–21 years.22,23 Several 
scoring systems have been proposed to determine the risk 
of VTE in individual pediatric trauma patients and to inform
