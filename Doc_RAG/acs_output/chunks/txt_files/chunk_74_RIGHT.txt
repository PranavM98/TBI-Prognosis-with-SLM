POSTACUTE CARE
symptoms. Supportive care and rehabilitative therapies 
are effective in treating patients with TBI and GCS 13–15 to 
restore maximum functional capacity. Systems for follow-
up care are admittedly lacking for these patients in the US 
and around the world. In addition to data demonstrating 
relatively low detection of patients with TBI and GCS 13–15 
in EDs, recent studies indicate that most patients do not 
receive helpful information resources at time of hospital 
discharge or any further evaluation and treatment of their 
injury, even when experiencing persistent symptoms.14 
When possible, such patients need to be seen by clinicians 
with expertise in the management of TBI. A multispecialty 
approach is ideal to address the multifaceted sequelae 
of TBI. Healthcare systems are encouraged to develop 
coordinated programs for postacute care of TBI patients.
Resources 
Consensus guidelines developed by the American 
Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine (ACRM), the CDC, 
the US Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of 
Defense, and the sports medicine community are available 
for the management of civilians, military service members, 
and athletes affected by TBI with GCS 13–15 (see Box 8). 
Providers responsible for the evaluation and management 
of these specific populations of patients with TBI and 
GCS 13–15 need to be familiar with existing guidelines and 
incorporate them into their clinical practice.
