IMPLEMENTATION AND INTEGRATION OF THE BEST PRACTICES GUIDELINES
IMPLEMENTATION AND 

INTEGRATION INTO TRAUMA 

CENTER PERFORMANCE 
IMPROVEMENT
KEY POINTS
 
• The interdisciplinary workgroup defines elements of 
the ACS TQP Best Practices Guidelines for the Management 
of Traumatic Brain Injury to monitor through the trauma 
Performance Improvement and Patient Safety (PIPS) 
processes.
 
• After approval by the trauma PIPS committee, the 
approved elements are integrated into the existing 
trauma PIPS plan for compliance monitoring.
 
• The PI elements of the ACS TQP Best Practices Guidelines 
for the Management of Traumatic Brain Injury are 
integrated into the current structure and processes of 
the PIPS plans.
Regional System Integration
A regional system may choose to develop a regional 
collaborative to review and coordinate TBI care across 
the region. This collaborative initiative is interdisciplinary 
and needs to include both rehabilitation and psychosocial 
services. The TBI collaborative defines its priorities and 
focus, which may require regional data related to TBI and 
outcomes. 
Potential priorities for development of regional TBI 
guidelines and related regional commitments include the 
following:
 
• Prehospital care, field triage, and destination—requires 
the trauma center to share data related to TBI injury 
outcomes
 
• Early access to rehabilitation—requires the region to 
identify the various levels and types of rehabilitation 
services available
 
• Postacute follow-up for all TBI patients—requires the 
region to identify clinicians experienced in managing TBI
 
• Psychosocial and peer-to-peer support—requires the 
region to identify community resources for patients with 
TBI
