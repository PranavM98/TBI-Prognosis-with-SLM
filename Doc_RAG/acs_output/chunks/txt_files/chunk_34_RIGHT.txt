PATIENT MANAGEMENT
34
Secondary decompressive craniectomy: This procedure 
involves removing a bone flap to control brain swelling, 
as well as elevated ICP that is refractory to medical 
treatment. Patients with hematomas, contusions, and/or 
diffuse injury that do not have an indication for immediate 
surgery are managed medically. However, in the presence 
of raised and refractory ICP (> 25 mm Hg), secondary 
decompressive craniectomy was demonstrated to reduce 
mortality and improve outcome over time (24-month 
data).3,4 The RESCUEicp trial predicted that if 100 patients 
are treated with secondary decompressive craniectomy 
(compared to conservative management), there are 21 extra 
survivors with the following functional outcomes: one-third 
independent outside the home, one-third independent in 
the home, and one-third dependent (see Figure 4).3
