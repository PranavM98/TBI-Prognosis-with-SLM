PATIENT MANAGEMENT
30
 
• Increase PaO2 above 150 mm Hg (Tier Three) 
 
• Transfuse 1 unit of packed red blood cells if PbtO2 
remains less than 20 mm Hg despite CPP optimization 
(Tier Three) 
Knowledge of cerebral autoregulation status as described 
above may also facilitate the use of PbtO2 to individualize 
CPP goals. Keep the potential harmful effects of hyperoxia 
in mind, especially when proceeding to Tier Three therapies. 
Electroencephalography
Use of EEG allows continuous monitoring of brain 
function at the bedside, assisting in seizure detection and 
management. It has a significant role in the detection 
of nonconvulsive seizures as the potential cause for a 
diminished level of consciousness that would otherwise 
go undetected.12 Nonconvulsive seizures were reported to 
occur in an estimated 25% of patients with moderate to 
severe TBI, and they were reported to be associated with 
worse outcomes and long-term hippocampal atrophy.13–14
Surface EEG requires a trained, on-site technician and a 
physician trained to interpret the waveforms. Emerging 
techniques, including quantitative EEG, may decrease the 
need for a physician trained to interpret waveforms, but 
this is not available at all trauma centers. The role of EEG 
is expanding beyond the detection of seizures. While still 
considered experimental, the detection of secondary brain 
ischemia and covert consciousness is possible using depth 
and surface EEG. 
Multimodal Neuromonitoring
Trauma centers treating larger numbers of patients 
with severe TBI, and those centers with expertise in 
neurocritical care, may attempt to undertake multimodality 
neuromonitoring, incorporating at least one element of 
neuromonitoring beyond ICP monitoring in isolation. 
Trauma centers treating lower volumes of patients with TBI 
may not have the resources to implement a full regimen of 
neuromonitoring beyond ICP monitoring.
