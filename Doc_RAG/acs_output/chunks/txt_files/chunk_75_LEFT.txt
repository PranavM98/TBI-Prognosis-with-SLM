Older Adult Considerations
Mild TBI, or TBI in patients with a GCS score of 13–15, 
occurs frequently in older adults, often resulting from a 
fall. Studies report that the majority of TBI in older adults 
(60%–80%) is associated with a GCS score of 13–15.15–17 
Unfortunately, little evidence exists to guide diagnostic 
or therapeutic decision-making for these injuries in older 
adults.18,19
The evaluation of an older adult patient with mild TBI may 
be significantly confounded by preinjury cognitive status. 
Additionally, for older adult patients, a discrepancy of 
observed GCS is often reported when compared to younger 
adult patients with similar anatomic injury.20,21 A GCS score 
and physical examination cannot reliably exclude significant 
intracranial pathology in an older adult; therefore, liberal 
imaging and observation are often recommended.22–24
While most older patients with these injuries recover 
well, TBI with a GCS score of 13–15 is reported to be 
an independent significant risk factor of death in older 
adults.17 Additionally, these injuries may result in long-term 
changes in self-perception and social life that can persist 
for years after injury.25 Such changes can lead to loss of 
independence and deterioration in quality of life. Older 
adults who have significant or persistent symptoms that do 
not improve often benefit from referral to highly specialized 
rehabilitation.26,27 
Pediatric Considerations
Approximately 30% of children with TBI and GCS 13–15 
will have persistent symptoms 1 month after injury.28 A 
recent large-scale observational study identified risk factors 
(e.g., history of physician-diagnosed migraine) and exam 
findings (e.g., answering questions slowly) associated 
with prolonged symptoms.28 Evidence from observational 
and intervention trials suggests that early reinstitution 
of physical activity and early return to school improve 
outcomes.29–32 Refer all children with TBI to their primary 
care clinician for management of return to school and 
return to activity. Follow-up in a subspeciality clinic, such 
as neurology or sports medicine, may be warranted in 
children with risk factors for prolonged recovery. Children 
with prolonged symptoms (i.e., persistent symptoms at 3 
months) may benefit from neuropsychological testing to
