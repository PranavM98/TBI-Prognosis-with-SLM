Include the following in the brain MRI protocol: T1, T2, T2 
fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, diffusion-weighted 
imaging/apparent diffusion coefficient, susceptibility-
weighted imaging (SWI) or, if unavailable, conventional T2*-
weighted gradient echo. SWI and T2*-weighted gradient 
echo sequences are very sensitive to blood products and 
greatly enhance the visibility of microhemorrhages that are 
often occult on CT.
