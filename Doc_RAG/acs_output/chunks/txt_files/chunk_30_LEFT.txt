Monitoring cerebral blood flow: Directly monitoring CBF 
can also be used to assess autoregulation status with a 
MAP challenge.2 In patients with intact autoregulation, 
CBF will change minimally in response to an increase in 
MAP. Conversely, CBF will rise with increasing MAP in 
patients with impaired autoregulation. Once determined, 
autoregulation status can be used to set CPP goals 
as described above. Similarly, transcranial doppler 
ultrasonography and hemodynamic challenge can also be 
used to assess autoregulation in TBI patients. 
Research findings: Multiple studies demonstrated an 
association between low PbtO2 (≤ 15 mm Hg) and episodes 
of jugular venous oxygen desaturation (≤ 50%) with poor 
patient outcomes.3–7 It is important to note that brain tissue 
hypoxia can occur even when ICP and CPP are normal. A 
Phase II prospective RCT (BOOST II) investigating PbtO2-
based management of severe TBI compared treatment 
guided by ICP alone to treatment guided by both ICP and 
PbtO2. This study demonstrated that the ICP + PbtO2 
management group had statistically significant decreased 
duration and severity of brain hypoxia, as well as a trend 
towards reduced mortality and improved neurologic 
outcome at 6 months.8 However, this trial was not powered 
to show significant differences in outcome. Several 
appropriately powered Phase III trials (BOOST III and 
BONANZA) are underway to compare outcomes between 
therapy guided by ICP alone versus therapy guided by ICP 
+ PbtO2. The recently concluded Oxy-TC trial did not find a 
difference in functional outcome between nonpenetrating 
TBI patients treated with ICP + PbtO2-based monitoring 
versus those treated with ICP-based monitoring alone.9
Brain tissue oxygen management: Accepted thresholds 
for treatment of brain tissue hypoxia are between 15–20 
mm Hg.8,10,11 Interventions that may be used to improve 
brain tissue oxygenation are detailed in the tiered SIBICC II 
algorithm and include the following1:
 
• Increase fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) to 60% (Tier 
One) or increase PaO2 to as high as 150 mm Hg (Tier 
Two) 
 
• Attempt increased sedation or neuromuscular paralysis 
to improve PbtO2 (Tier Two)
 
• Increase CPP in patients with intact autoregulation per 
MAP challenge (Tier Two)
