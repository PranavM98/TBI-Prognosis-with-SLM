IMPLEMENTATION AND INTEGRATION OF THE BEST PRACTICES GUIDELINES
Table 10. Traumatic Brain Injury Management PI Recommendations
Performance Improvement Recommendations
Outcome Measure and Threshold
Documented facility guidelines for neurosurgical urgent 
evaluation 
Neurosurgical evaluation must occur within 30 minutes of request for the 
following injuries1:
 
• Severe TBI (GCS < 9) with head CT evidence of intracranial trauma
 
• Moderate TBI (GCS 9–12) with head CT evidence of potential 
intracranial mass 
 
• Neurologic deficit due to potential spinal cord injury
 
• GCS motor score < 6 
Consider prehospital transport of patients meeting listed 
criteria to the most appropriate trauma center with 
neurosurgical capability2 
 
• Skull deformity or suspected skull fracture
 
• Signs of basilar skull fracture
 
• Penetrating head injury
 
• Caregiver-reported change from baseline behavior in an infant/child 
following injury
 
• Significant intracranial injury (e.g., large SDH, EDH, IPH, IVH)
Consider transferring patients meeting listed criteria to a 
trauma center with neurotrauma expertise, where available 
(see Triage and Transport section on page 6)
 
• Displaced skull fracture 
 
• Suspected TBI (GCS score ≤ 15) and moderate to severe extracranial 
anatomic injuries, and/or inability to monitor for neurological 
deterioration when intracranial injury is present or suspected
Neurotrauma contingency plan is in place
Must be implemented when neurosurgery capabilities are encumbered or 
overwhelmed 
Monitoring of neurotrauma diversion is reported at least 
quarterly as part of the PIPS program, if neurotrauma diversion 
occurs
Diversion initiation (date/time) and discontinuation (date/time) are 
monitored and reported quarterly as part of the PIPS program 
Use of GCS individual components (eye, verbal, and motor 
scores) as the preferred method of measuring neurological 
status in TBI patients
Use of individual components of GCS in the prehospital and hospital 
settings, with frequent serial assessments and notation of changes
Documentation of individual GCS score components (eye, 
verbal, and motor scores) in the patient care report
All GCS individual components are documented
Pupil assessment documentation
 
• Clinical assessment is required 
 
• Consider use of quantitative pupillometry 
 
• Assessments repeated frequently and documented
Hemodynamics assessment documentation
 
• Age-specific measurement of hemodynamic status (blood pressure 
management) following acute TBI is required 
 
• Assessments repeated frequently and documented
 
• Standardized neurological assessment and documentation
Ongoing standardized neurological assessment and 
documentation 
 
• Assessments are repeated frequently and documented
Repeat imaging 
 
• Urgent repeat head CT scanning is indicated for a patient of any age 
with worsening changes on neurologic exam
 
• Repeat head CT is indicated in 6–12 hours after initial imaging when a 
patient of any age has a persistently altered mental status and initial 
CT showed traumatic abnormality
Appropriate timeliness and coordination of monitoring during 
imaging
Per individual facility
Consideration of blood-based biomarker testing for patients to 
reduce unnecessary CT imaging
Applies to patients ≥ 18 years of age with suspected TBI and a GCS of 
13–15 within 12 hours of injury
