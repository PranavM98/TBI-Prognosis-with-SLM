TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY 
EDUCATION AND FOLLOW-UP
KEY POINTS
 
• Treat TBI as both an acute and chronic condition.
 
• Patients with TBI and their families need targeted 
education about brain injury, recovery, resources, and 
follow-up care to enhance safety, coping, follow through, 
and outcome.
 
• Healthcare professionals can benefit from TBI education 
to improve patient care and outcomes.
 
• Upon discharge from the acute care hospital, ensure that 
all patients with TBI have the opportunity to follow-up 
with a clinician experienced in managing TBI. This allows 
for further evidence-informed education, as well as 
longer-term screening, surveillance, and treatment as 
needed.
Across all demographic and socioeconomic strata, TBI 
remains a leading cause of disability worldwide.1 For many 
patients, TBI is a persisting and dynamic condition, not a 
one-time event.2 The enormous burden of this condition 
can have profound implications for patients, their families, 
and their communities. Patients who present with coma 
and severe TBI are known to need rehabilitation and long-
term chronic care. However, many of these patients do 
not receive rehabilitation or chronic care from a clinician 
experienced in managing TBI, and many do not receive any 
follow-up care because of criteria for healthcare eligibility 
and benefits. Based on US data gathered during the early 
2000s, it was estimated that only 13%–25% of persons 
hospitalized acutely with moderate, severe, or penetrating 
TBI received inpatient rehabilitation.3 
Among patients less severely injured, even fewer receive 
rehabilitation or a connection with a healthcare professional 
knowledgeable about TBI. Over the past decade, an 
increasing body of evidence indicates that patients 
presenting to trauma centers for evaluation and treatment 
of mild TBI (GCS 13–15) experience symptoms and 
impairments that persist beyond the acute and subacute 
phases of recovery, even though they often do not require 
intensive acute medical management or hospitalization.4
