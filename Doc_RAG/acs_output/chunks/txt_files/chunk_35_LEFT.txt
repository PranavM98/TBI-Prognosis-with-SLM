Other Surgical Decisions 
Traumatic intracerebral hematoma/hemorrhagic 
contusion: Management for this condition remains 
controversial. For patients with mass effect and neurological 
decline, the decision for surgical intervention is more 
straightforward. However, for patients with smaller 
lesions, the choice of early surgery to prevent secondary 
injury is debatable. The STITCH (Trauma) trial, which was 
prematurely terminated due to slow patient recruitment, 
demonstrated improved survival in the early surgery group 
and a trend towards better functional outcome, especially 
in the subgroup with GCS 9–12.5 More recently, early 
surgery versus conservative treatment was studied in the 
prospective longitudinal CENTER-TBI cohort. For traumatic 
intracerebral hematoma in patients with GCS 9–12 or an 
isolated traumatic intracerebral hematoma, early surgery 
was associated with improved outcome, similar to the 
STITCH (Trauma) study.6
