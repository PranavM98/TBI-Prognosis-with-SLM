Factors that can affect \nprehospital triage accuracy with older adults include the \nfollowing: major trauma resulting from low-energy impact \nmechanisms (low-level falls) not captured by the current \ntriage tools, polypharmacy, age-related physiological \nresponses to injuries, frailty, and anticoagulant and \nantiplatelet medication use.

In older adults, the verbal component of the GCS may \nbe confounded by preexisting conditions such as delirium, \ndementia, and aphasia. The component that is most \nassociated with long-term outcomes is the motor score.\nThe GCS can be used during all phases of patient care. \nAdopt a standardized approach for both assessment and \nreporting to ensure reliable patient assessment over time \nand for accurate communication between healthcare \nprofessionals. Complete a baseline assessment as soon as \npossible, after imminent threats to life are managed. \nWhen used in individual patients, assess and document \neach of the GCS component scores (e.g., Eye 4, Verbal \n4, Motor 6). Each GCS component score provides \ncomplementary information with differential relevance \nacross injury severities.7 The eye and verbal component \nscores are more discriminating in patients with less severe \nbrain injuries. For the assessment of more severe brain \ninjuries, the motor score is more relevant. Use this sequence \nwhen assessing the GCS: \n \n• Observe and record spontaneous patient activities and \nresponses prior to the application of any stimulus. \n \n• Provide verbal stimuli while observing for eye opening, \nverbal, or upper extremity motor responses. Note: \nDocument only the reactions of the best arm, not the \nlegs. \n \n• Use another stimulus to elicit a response (e.g., fingertip \npressure, supra-orbital pressure, trapezius pinch) if the \npatient has no response to verbal stimuli. Document \nthe type of stimulus applied (i.e., central or peripheral), \nand then use this stimulus as a standard for future \nassessments.\nThe individual component scores of the GCS may be \nsummed to provide a useful measure for overall injury \nclassification, prognosis estimation (in conjunction with \nother factors), and patient group-level comparisons.",

Some degree of pupillary \nasymmetry may be normal, but the development of new \npupillary asymmetry can indicate compression of the \nbrainstem with impending uncal herniation, triggering \nthe need for further evaluation and intervention. In uncal \nherniation, the parasympathetic fibers on the surface of \nthe third cranial nerve are compressed, leading to a slowly \nreactive—or eventually unreactive—pupil. A unilateral \nunreactive pupil is consistent with an ipsilateral mass lesion, \nwhile bilaterally fixed and dilated pupils portend a poor \noverall prognosis for functional recovery. \nOlder Adults: In older adults, evaluation of the pupillary \nresponse may be confounded by preexisting chronic \nophthalmic diseases (e.g., glaucoma or cataract disease). \nQuantitative pupillometry may be of limited value in \npatients with postsurgical pupils (i.e., after cataract \nsurgery), however, this does not influence pupillary light \nreflex parameters measured by automated pupillometry.9,10 \nIn these patients, a medical history is essential to correctly \ninterpret physical examination findings such as an abnormal \npupillary light reflex, anisocoria, or oculomotor palsy. \nQuantitative Pupillometry: Both the inter-rater and intra-\nrater reliability of the standard clinical determination of \npupillary size and reactivity are relatively poor.

However, use \nCT judiciously, due to the greater vulnerability of children \nto radiation-induced malignancy.10,11 In order to mitigate \nthe risks of radiation to the developing brain, some trauma \ncenters are performing rapid MRI as first-line imaging \nin nonsedated infants and young children.11–13 Regardless",

More than 80% of \npatients with GCS 3–12 have evidence of intracranial injury.15 \nThe Rotterdam CT score uses traumatic intracranial CT \nimaging features (basal cistern effacement, midline shift, \nEDH, IVH, and subarachnoid hemorrhage) to determine a \nscore (1 to 6) that is predictive of 6-month mortality related \nto TBI in patients with GCS 3–12. While the incidence of CT \nabnormalities in patients with GCS 13–15 is lower, certain \nfeatures such as subarachnoid hemorrhage, contusion, and \nSDH are associated with incomplete recovery, and IVH and/\nor petechial hemorrhage are associated with more severe \nimpairment.16 \nClinical Role of MRI\nMRI has superior sensitivity relative to CT for most acute \nintracranial findings, including small brain contusions, small \nextra-axial hematomas,17,18 and microhemorrhages and \nsmall white-matter lesions that represent acute traumatic \naxonal and/or microvascular injury. Several studies reported \nthat more than 25% of patients with TBI presenting to \nLevel 1 trauma centers with a negative initial head CT are \ndetermined to have intracranial injuries upon brain MRI.17 \nThus, a negative initial head CT does not rule out a TBI. \nThe injuries identified on MRI predict disability in TBI.17,18 \nIn current clinical practice, brain MRI is used mainly for \ninvestigation of persistent concerns (e.g., unexplained  \nalteration in consciousness in acute TBI, management of \nsubacute TBI with persistent symptoms or deficits, and \nidentification of intracranial injuries not detected by CT). \nBEST PRACTICES GUIDELINES: THE MANAGEMENT OF TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY",

Rather, it \ndemonstrated the importance of aggressive treatment \nusing ICP monitoring or, alternatively, frequent clinical \nand radiographic examination to identify intracranial \nhypertension.4 The findings of this study also challenge \nthe currently accepted rigid ICP alert threshold used for \nall patients. The currently accepted alert threshold is an \nICP of 22 mm Hg, with a reasonable range of 20–25 mm \nHg for more than 5 minutes, as a trigger for treatment \nof intracranial hypertension; however, ongoing research \nsuggests that this threshold is dependent upon individual \npatient factors such as injury type and severity.

Higher ICP dose is \nassociated with worse outcomes over the entire Glasgow \nOutcome Scale (GOS) range, not only mortality.5 \nEscalation of treatment for intracranial hypertension needs \nto be based on both the level and duration of ICP elevation. \nFor example, the threshold for proceeding to higher-tier \ntherapies such as decompressive craniectomy needs to be \nat a higher ICP threshold, or “dose,” as demonstrated by the \nRESCUE-ICP trial.6 A trend over time is more relevant than \na momentary ICP value.

Information on the use of direct-acting \noral anticoagulants as an alternative to warfarin is limited. \nGenerally, treatment with antithrombotic agents continues \nfor at least 3 months.26 Follow-up noninvasive imaging \nwith CT angiography or MRI at 3 months is reasonable \nto assess healing.26 Consider reserving endovascular \ntherapy with stenting or coil embolization for nonhealing \npseudoaneurysms or recurrent cerebral ischemic events \ndespite antithrombotic therapy.29 Primary endovascular \nembolization/sacrifice of an artery affected by BCVI is often \nnot recommended as an initial strategy. This is because of \nthe risk of periprocedural complications29 and the natural \nhistory of healing for many lesions, as long as the patient \nis protected from thromboembolic events by some form \nof antithrombotic therapy.

Older adults are more commonly injured by \nlower-energy mechanisms, and they may not receive liberal \nscreening for BCVI.32 However, older adults are at high risk \nfor injuries typically associated with BCVI, such as vertebral \nbody fractures. Although the overall incidence of BCVI is \nlower in older adults than in younger cohorts, BCVIs are \nfound relatively commonly after ground-level falls.14 The \nconsequences of these injuries in older adult patients \ncan be devastating. Not only are they more likely to have \nhigher-grade lesions, but BCVI in older patients are also \nan independent risk factor for mortality.14,33 Perform liberal \nscreening in older adult patients with risk factors for BCVI. \nPediatric Considerations\nPediatric evaluation for BCVI must consider the additional \nrisk of radiation exposure in children. BCVI prevalence is \nlower in the pediatric population compared to adults, and \napplication of the Denver criteria would likely overestimate \nBCVI incidence.34 The Utah score is a validated BCVI \nscoring system with high specificity and incorporates risk \nfactors to classify patients as “low” or “high” risk of BCVI-\nrelated complication (see Table 5).35,36 The McGovern \nmodification adds two points for severe injury mechanism \nrelated to motor vehicle collision and results in increased \nsensitivity for BCVI diagnosis.37",

This allows \nfor further evidence-informed education, as well as \nlonger-term screening, surveillance, and treatment as \nneeded.\nAcross all demographic and socioeconomic strata, TBI \nremains a leading cause of disability worldwide.1 For many \npatients, TBI is a persisting and dynamic condition, not a \none-time event.2 The enormous burden of this condition \ncan have profound implications for patients, their families, \nand their communities. Patients who present with coma \nand severe TBI are known to need rehabilitation and long-\nterm chronic care. However, many of these patients do \nnot receive rehabilitation or chronic care from a clinician \nexperienced in managing TBI, and many do not receive any \nfollow-up care because of criteria for healthcare eligibility \nand benefits. Based on US data gathered during the early \n2000s, it was estimated that only 13%–25% of persons \nhospitalized acutely with moderate, severe, or penetrating \nTBI received inpatient rehabilitation.3 \nAmong patients less severely injured, even fewer receive \nrehabilitation or a connection with a healthcare professional \nknowledgeable about TBI. Over the past decade, an \nincreasing body of evidence indicates that patients \npresenting to trauma centers for evaluation and treatment \nof mild TBI (GCS 13–15) experience symptoms and \nimpairments that persist beyond the acute and subacute \nphases of recovery, even though they often do not require \nintensive acute medical management or hospitalization.4 \nBEST PRACTICES GUIDELINES: THE MANAGEMENT OF TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY",

    "text": "POSTACUTE CARE\nAdditionally, nearly 50% of this less severely injured patient \npopulation receives no education about their TBI injury at \nthe time of discharge, and they have no form of postacute \nfollow-up care or education.5 \nWhile current TBI education platforms and resources can \nbe improved and expanded, numerous resources exist (e.g., \nCDC, Model Systems, and BrainLine).6–8 TBI education can \nimprove patient outcomes, and encouraging clinician and \npatient use of these existing resources is important.9 An \nimportant priority for trauma centers is the development of \ncoordinated patient education and follow-up systems. \nHealthcare professionals need TBI education to be informed \nabout recent data from large-scale studies demonstrating \nthat long-term patient outcome may not mirror patient \npresentation. This highlights the need for follow-up patient \ncare and education after TBI. Specifically, many patients \nwith severe injuries can have good outcomes, while many \npatients with so-called mild injuries can experience \npersistent problems that negatively impact their life \nfunction. Healthcare professionals also need to be educated \non patient TBI outcome differences related to sport-related \nTBI versus community-acquired TBI that results in transfer \nto a trauma center.\nThere is a significant shortage of TBI follow-up care systems \nin the US and worldwide. As a result, the majority of TBI \npatients do not receive adequate follow-up care.5 Many \nsymptoms of TBI (e.g., headache, sleep disturbance, various \nforms of cognitive dysfunction, vestibular dysfunction, \nspasticity, weakness, sensory changes, decreased stamina, \nand others) need treatment to prevent disability and \nimprove outcomes after TBI. Outcomes are improved with \nTBI follow-up and treatment by clinicians experienced in \nmanaging TBI.10 Trauma centers and community healthcare \nsystems are encouraged to facilitate development of \ncoordinated systems for postacute care for TBI patients \nwith providers experienced in managing TBI. Peer-to-peer \nTBI support opportunities, such as TBI patient support \ngroups, are also important for education and support for \nindividuals and families to manage the challenges faced by \ntheir condition, treatment, and recovery.",
