Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
The Poon et al study (Model A) did not 
distinguish between patients that were 
severely disabled (SD) and those that 
were moderately disabled (MD). For 
these patients we used the simple 
average of the two SMRs and the simple 
average of the two utilities. 
Another study was found, Tsauo 
1999203, which reported the utility 
scores associated with each GOS score 
obtained from health professionals in the 
UK using the standard gamble method.  
We did not use this study in our base 
case model for the following reasons: 
- scores were presented for a number 
of time points and there seemed to be 
inconsistency between the estimates 
- the figures were skewed towards high 
values (i.e. the utility associated with a 
moderate disability was higher than the 
average EQ5D utility score for the 
general population in the UK201)  
- the value for the vegetative state was 
missing 
- the number of the health professionals 
interviewed for the elicitation of the 
utility scores was not reported.  
Therefore, we used this study only for 
the purpose of sensitivity analysis.
