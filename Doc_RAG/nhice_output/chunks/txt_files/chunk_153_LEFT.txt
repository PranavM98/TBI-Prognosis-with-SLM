The cost per patient for each strategy was calculated on the basis of the expected usage of skull 
X-ray, head CT scan and 24 hour observation. It was not possible to quantify differences in 
health outcomes and other cost outcomes (Table 11.2, outcomes 4-10).

9. Reduction in litigation costs

10. Change in primary care use as a result of 3, 4 and 5

NB – Any increase in resource use has a negative effect for society because those resources can’t 
then be used for some other beneficial purpose. 
 
Usage figures were derived from Nee et al 176 for the current (pre-2003) UK system and from 
Stiell et al 25 for the Canadian rules (Table 11.3). For the US model, usage was determined by 
the model definition.
