clinical outcome. The interventions tested 
were helical CT (n=381) and X-rays 
(single cross-table lateral) (n=421). 
Only 421 patients had a cross table 
lateral film as 21 patients went straight 
to CT for clinical reasons. 381 patients 
had a CT scan that was followed up by 
MRI or clinical outcome. Cervical spine 
injuries were found in 14% of the 
patients. CT scans were more sensitive 
than X-rays (98.1% vs 72.1% 
respectively). X-rays had a lower 
specificity (94.2%) than CT scans 
(98.8%). Only 200 of the X-rays were 
adequate.

6.7.4 
Summary of evidence from 2007 
update 
The meta-analsyis108 found that CT had 
a higher sensitivity than X-rays. 
Nygren109 found that X-rays had a 
sensitivity of 93.3% in high risk blunt 
trauma patients (CT was used as the 
reference standard). Brohi et al110 found 
that CT scans had a higher sensitivity 
than X-rays in a group of unconscious 
intubated blunt trauma patients.  
The economic evidence117-120 suggests 
that CT scanning of the cervical spine is 
cost-effective in higher risk groups who 
are already undergoing head CT. 
However, the costs and health 
consequences associated with the 
increased radiation exposure were not 
taken into account, and the settings of 
these studies were outside the UK NHS.
