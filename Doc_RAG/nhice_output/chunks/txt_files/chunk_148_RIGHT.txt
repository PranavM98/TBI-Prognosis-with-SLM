mortality risks from CT examinations on 
a one-year-old child are approximately 
an order of magnitude higher than the 
risks for CT-scanned adults.171This is due 
to both an increased dose for children 
having CT scans in the USA at the time 
(2001) compared to adults, and an 
estimated increase in risk per unit dose 
of about a factor of 3 for a one year 
old child. While this paper calculates a 
projected 500 additional cancer deaths 
per year in the USA from the number of 
paediatric CT examinations performed 
in 2001, this only represents a 0.35% 
increase in the background cancer death 
rate.  
In summary, the best available evidence 
suggests that paediatric CT will result in 
increased lifetime risks of cancer 
compared to adult CT due to both the 
higher radiation doses currently 
delivered to children and their increased 
sensitivity to radiation-induced cancer 
over a longer life span.

Radiation exposure management 
In line with good radiation exposure 
practice every effort should be made to 
minimise radiation dose during 
imaging of the head and cervical 
spine, while ensuring that image 
quality and coverage is sufficient to 
achieve an adequate diagnostic study.  
In spite of the potential risks of 
increased radiation exposure as a 
result of these guidelines, the 
consensus opinion of the Guideline 
Development Group is that this is 
justified by the increased effectiveness 
in identifying and managing patients 
with significant brain injuries.
