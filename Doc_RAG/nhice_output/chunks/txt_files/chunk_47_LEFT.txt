Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
[New] Children under 10 years of age 
with a Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of 
8 or less should have CT imaging of 
the cervical spine within 1 hour of 
presentation or when they are 
sufficiently stable. 
[Amended] Imaging of the cervical 
spine should be performed within 1 
hour of a request having been 
received by the radiology department 
or when the patient is sufficiently 
stable. Where a request for urgent CT 
imaging of the head (that is, within 1 
hour) has also been received, the 
cervical spine imaging should be 
carried out simultaneously. 
3.1.3 
Admission 
[Amended] In circumstances where a 
patient with a head injury requires 
hospital admission, it is recommended 
that the patient be admitted only under 
the care of a team led by a consultant 
who has been trained in the 
management of this condition during 
his/her higher specialist training. The 
consultant and his/her team should 
have competence (defined by local 
agreement with the neuroscience unit) 
in assessment, observation and 
indications for imaging (see 
recommendations in 3.7); inpatient 
management; indications for transfer 
to a neuroscience unit (see 
recommendations in 3.6); and hospital 
discharge and follow-up (see 
recommendations in 3.8).
