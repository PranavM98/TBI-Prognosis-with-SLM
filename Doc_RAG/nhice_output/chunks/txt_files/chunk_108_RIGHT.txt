The rationale for this amendment to the 
previous recommendation is that in this 
group of head injured patients (GCS Â” 
13) X-rays are not able to detect all 
cervical spine injuries and the risk of 
cervical spine injury is higher than in the 
less severely head injured patients. The 
update evidence is level two evidence. 
The recommendation is based on the 
evidence retrieved along with the GDG 
consensus. The GDG agreed that this 
change to the recommendation could 
also be applied for children as there is 
no evidence at present to suggest 
otherwise. 
6.7.6 
Recommendation 
[Amended] The current initial 
investigation of choice for the 
detection of injuries to the cervical 
spine is the plain radiograph. Three 
views should be obtained and be of 
sufficient quality for reliable 
interpretation. However, in certain 
circumstances CT is preferred.  
[NEW] Adult patients who have any of 
the following risk factors should have 
CT imaging of the cervical spine 
requested immediately: 
- GCS below 13 on initial assessment 
- Has been intubated 
- Plain film series is technically 
inadequate (for example, desired view 
unavailable), suspicious or definitely 
abnormal  
- Continued clinical suspicion of injury 
despite a normal X ray. 
- The patient is being scanned for 
multi-region trauma.
