6.1 
Focus of emergency department 
assessment in patients with a head injury 
The main risk to patients who have 
sustained a recent head injury is the 
development of a clinically important 
brain injury. Some brain injuries require 
an early neurosurgical intervention (for 
example, intracranial haematoma 
requiring evacuation) but the life 
threatening nature of the injury makes 
early detection essential. Other clinically 
important brain injuries do not provide

may produce late sequelae. Early 
identification of these latter injuries may 
assist in rehabilitation.
