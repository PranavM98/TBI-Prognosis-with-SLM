Transport from community health services 
and NHS minor injury clinics and prehospital management 
- Patients referred from community 
health services and NHS minor injury 
clinics should be accompanied by a 
competent adult during transport to the 
emergency department.  
- The referring professional should 
determine if an ambulance is required, 
based on the patient's clinical 
condition. If an ambulance is deemed 
not required, public transport and car 
are appropriate means of transport 
providing the patient is accompanied.  
- The referring professional should 
inform the destination hospital (by 
phone) of the impending transfer and 
in non-emergencies a letter 
summarising signs and symptoms 
should be sent with the patient. 
These recommendations are based on 
level five evidence and are considered 
to be grade D recommendations.
