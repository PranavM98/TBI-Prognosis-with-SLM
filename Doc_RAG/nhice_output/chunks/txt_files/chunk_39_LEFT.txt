Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
read by two reviewers to identify those 
papers that should be obtained and 
read in full. At this point the only criteria 
used was the likelihood that the paper 
described a rule for the diagnosis of 
cervical fracture, and produced some 
data on the likely sensitivity and 
specificity of the rule. Both derivation 
and validation papers were selected. 
The independent reviewing process 
produced 78 papers in MEDLINE and 7 
papers in EMBASE. In total 85 papers 
were deemed worthy of review. 
A brief description of the rule proposed 
was extracted. Many papers did not 
provide an explicit description of the 
diagnostic strategies, inclusion criteria, or 
post-diagnosis management strategies 
(for example, eligibility for early 
discharge). 
Participant details extracted included 
symptom status, alertness, age, number 
of centres, prevalence of important 
outcomes, the country of study and the 
main inclusion and exclusion criteria. The 
outcomes that the rule is intended to 
detect were noted. These included 
clinically important cervical fracture, 
unimportant cervical spine fracture, need 
for surgery and internal or external 
fixation. The radiography ordering rate 
was also noted as an outcome. Data on 
specificity and sensitivity were recorded 
where possible; 95% confidence 
intervals were also recorded or 
calculated if possible.
