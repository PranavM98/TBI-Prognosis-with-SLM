of death was taken from the database. Having these two points on the probability of death 
graph, a straight line was drawn.  The authors found that the results were not sensitive to the 
slope of the line. However, the curve representing the real relationship between time to 
intervention and probability of death could have a different shape. 
Table 11.26: Parameters for which the value was estimated by clinicians. 
Deaths from injuries in areas excluding the head if medical 
intervention could be given immediately 
 
Deaths from a head injury that required neurosurgery if 
neurosurgical intervention could be given immediately  
 
Deaths from a head injury that did not require neurosurgery if 
medical intervention could be given immediately 
 
Reduction in transfer deterioration due to staff expertise 
 
Delays administering intubation and delay before making a 
neurosurgical decision (according to the level of staff expertise) 
 
Increased mortality risk due to a secondary referral 
 
Extra risk of mortality if the patient suffers hypotension or full 
hypoxia
