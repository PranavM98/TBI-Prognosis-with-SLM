Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
Both studies excluded patients who had 
experienced no loss of consciousness. The 
New Orleans study reports an overall 
abnormal CT rate of 6.5% and a 
surgical intervention rate of 0.4%, while 
the Canadian study reports a rate of 
clinically important brain injury of 8% 
and a neurosurgical intervention rate of 
1%. The Canadian study included only 
patients with an initial GCS on arrival at 
hospital of 13 to 15 and assumed that 
all patients with GCS less than 13 would 
receive immediate CT. Four per cent of 
patients in this study had an initial GCS 
of 13 and 17% had a GCS of 14, with 
the remaining 79% having a GCS of 15. 
The New Orleans study focused on 
patients with GCS equal to 15 in the 
emergency department (assuming that 
all patients with GCS less than 15 would 
receive immediate CT) and therefore 
had a lower severity sample than was 
seen in the Canadian sample. 
The cohort used for the derivation of the 
Canadian Head CT rule contained 69% 
males, 11% greater than or equal to 65 
years and 31% patients who had 
sustained a fall, similar to figures for the 
UK. However, as noted in section 1.8: 
cause of injury, the proportion of 
assaults seen in the Canadian sample 
(11%) is lower than is usually quoted for 
the UK (30-50%). By contrast, the 
proportion of road traffic accidents in 
the Canadian sample (43% if injuries 
involving pedestrians and cyclists are 
included) is higher than estimates of 
25% for the UK. It is not clear whether 
this reflects broad difference in injury 
patterns between the two countries, or 
simply reflects the specific group of 
patients selected for the Canadian study
