Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
few new members were involved in this 
update where the Chair and NCC felt

The group met every 6-8 weeks during 
the development of the guideline. At the 
start of the guideline development 
process all GDG members declared 
interests including consultancies, fee-paid 
work, share-holdings, fellowships and 
support from the healthcare industry. At 
all subsequent GDG meetings, members 
declared arising conflicts of interest, 
which were also recorded (Appendix B). 
Members are either required to 
withdraw completely or for part of the 
discussion if their declared interest 
makes it appropriate, however this was 
not deemed necessary for any group 
members on this guideline. 
Staff from the NCC-AC provided 
methodological support and guidance 
for the development process. They 
undertook systematic searches, retrieval 
and appraisal of the evidence and 
drafted the guideline. The glossary to 
the guideline contains definitions of 
terms used by staff and the GDG.
