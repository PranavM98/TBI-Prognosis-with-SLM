Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
was also an important determinant of 
study quality. Systematic reviews of 
studies on the development of clinical 
decision studies and/or prognostic 
variables in head injury were also 
sought.   
The Guideline Development Group 
agreed to use classifications adapted 
from the Oxford Centre for Evidencebased Medicine Levels of Evidence (May 
2001), to summarise the evidence levels 
for reviewed studies. These differ from 
the levels of evidence normally used by 
NICE, as the NICE classification is not 
suitable for certain study designs. 
The levels of evidence used for studies 
on the development of clinical decision 
rules were as follows: 
1. Cohort study with consecutive patients 
and good reference standards, used to 
validate clinical decision rules; 
2. Cohort study with consecutive patients 
and good reference standards used to 
derive clinical decision rules (or 
validated on split samples only); 
3. Non-consecutive study or without 
consistently applied reference 
standards; 
4. Case-control study, poor or nonindependent reference standard; 
5. Expert opinion without explicit critical 
appraisal, or based on physiology, 
bench research or "first principles". 
The levels of evidence used for 
systematic reviews were as follows:
