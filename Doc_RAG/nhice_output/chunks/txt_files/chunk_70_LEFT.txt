Transfer of adults 
3.9.8.1 
The possibility of occult extracranial 
injuries should be considered for the 
multiply injured adult, and he or she 
should not be transferred to a service 
that is unable to deal with other aspects 
of trauma.

Recommendations for research 
The GDG identified the following 
priority area for research. 
3.10.1 
Is the clinical outcome of head injury 
patients with a reduced level of 
consciousness improved by direct 
transport from the scene of injury to a 
tertiary centre with neurosciences 
facilities compared with the outcome 
of those who are transported initially 
to the nearest hospital without 
neurosurgical facilities? 
The aim of this study is to conduct a 
comparison in patient outcome 
(mortality/morbidity) for those head 
injured patients that are transported 
directly to a centre with neurosciences 
facilities with the outcomes of those who 
are transported to the nearest hospital 
without neurosciences facilities, possibly 
necessitating a secondary transfer. 
Patients suffering from serious head 
injuries with a reduced level of 
consciousness are currently transported 
to the nearest hospital by land 
ambulance or helicopter. The nearest 
hospital may not have the resources or 
expertise to provide definitive care for 
these patients. Patients should be
