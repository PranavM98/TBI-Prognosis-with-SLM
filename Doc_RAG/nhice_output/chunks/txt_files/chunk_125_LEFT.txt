Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
2003 (n=6921). These patients were 
treated by participating hospitals in the 
Trauma Audit and Research Network 
(TARN), in the United Kingdom. The 
intervention group (n=4616) patients 
received care at a neurosurgical centre 
(including those who had been 
transferred which was 53% 
(2677/4982)). The control group 
(n=2305) patients received all their 
care in hospitals without neurosurgical 
facilities on site. The mortality rate for 
all patients that were transported to a 
neurosciences unit was 35% (95% CI, 
34-37%) and for those that were 
transported to the emergency 
department was 61% (95% CI, 5963%). The mortality rate for the 
subgroup (n=894) of patients with 
isolated, non-surgical severe head injury 
who were transported to a neurosciences 
unit was 26%, (95% CI, 22-29%) and 
for those that were transported to the 
emergency department the rate was 
34% (95% CI, 39-40%), p=0.005.  
The second study66 a retrospective 
observational cohort study (level 2+ 
evidence) examined the issue of bypass, 
which obtained data from the New York 
State Trauma Registry from 1996-1998. 
The population consisted of adults more 
than 13 years of age with a GCS less 
than 14. A sub group of 2763 head 
injured patients from the data set of 
5419 trauma patients was analysed. 
The patients in the intervention group 
(n=1430 (51.8%)) were transported to 
a regional trauma centre. These patients 
were assessed via the American Triage 
system (pre hospital care) and referred 
directly to the emergency department of 
a regional centre. The comparison group
