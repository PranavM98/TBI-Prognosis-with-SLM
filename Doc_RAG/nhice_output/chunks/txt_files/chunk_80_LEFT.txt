Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
NHS walk-in centres, dental 
practitioners) and NHS minor injury 
clinics should refer patients who have 
sustained a head injury to a hospital 
emergency department, using the 
ambulance service if deemed 
necessary (see section 4.17), if any of 
the following are present: 
- GCS less than 15 on initial 
assessment. 
- Any loss of consciousness as a 
result of the injury. 
- Any focal neurological deficit since 
the injury (examples include problems 
understanding, speaking, reading or 
writing; decreased sensation; loss of 
balance; general weakness; visual 
changes; abnormal reflexes; and 
problems walking). 
- Any suspicion of a skull fracture or 
penetrating head injury since the 
injury (for example, clear fluid running 
from the ears or nose, black eye with 
no associated damage around the 
eyes, bleeding from one or both ears, 
new deafness in one or both ears, 
bruising behind one or both ears, 
penetrating injury signs, visible 
trauma to the scalp or skull of concern 
to the professional). 
- Amnesia for events before or after 
the injury. The assessment of amnesia 
will not be possible in pre-verbal 
children and is unlikely to be possible 
in any child aged under 5 years. 
- Persistent headache since the injury.
