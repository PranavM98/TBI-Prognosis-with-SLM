in-hospital observation will on average 
have sustained a more severe head 
injury than is currently the case. These 
changes to current admission practice

patient discharge from hospital is safe 
and carefully planned. A very small 
number of patients will develop late 
complications despite normal CT results

discharge advice and post-discharge 
observation by a carer is required to 
ensure that these patients receive 
appropriate care as soon as possible. 
The role of carers at home in the early
