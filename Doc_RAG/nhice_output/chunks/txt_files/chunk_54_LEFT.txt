Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
with a head injury should be capable 
of assessing the presence or absence 
of the risk factors in the guidance on

should be available as required to 
ensure that this is the case. (D) 
3.5.1.4 
Patients presenting to the emergency

urgency for imaging (head and 
cervical spine – see later 
recommendations). (D) 
3.5.1.7 
[Amended] In patients considered to 
be at high risk for clinically important
