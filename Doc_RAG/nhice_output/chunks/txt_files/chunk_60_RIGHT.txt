minimise radiation dose during 
imaging of the head and cervical

quality and coverage is sufficient to 
achieve an adequate diagnostic study. 
3.5.10 
Involving the neurosurgeon 
3.5.10.1 The care of all patients with new, 
surgically significant abnormalities on 
imaging should be discussed with a 
neurosurgeon. The definition of 
‘surgically significant’ should be 
developed by local neurosurgical 
centres and agreed with referring 
hospitals. An example of a 
neurosurgical referral letter is shown 
in Appendix L. (D) 
3.5.10.2 Regardless of imaging, other reasons 
for discussing a patient’s care plan 
with a neurosurgeon include: 
- persisting coma (GCS  8) after 
initial resuscitation. 
- 
unexplained confusion which 
persists for more than 4 hours 
- 
deterioration in GCS after 
admission (greater attention 
should be paid to motor response 
deterioration) 
- 
progressive focal neurological 
signs 
- 
a seizure without full recovery 
- 
definite or suspected penetrating 
injury 
- 
a cerebrospinal fluid leak. (D)
