Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
11.6.4 
Cost-effectiveness model â€“ Direct 
transport 
We conducted a cost-effectiveness 
analysis of transporting patients with 
serious head injury directly from the 
injury scene to a specialist neurosciences 
hospital (NSH). This was compared to 
initially transporting such patients to the 
nearest emergency department and then 
later transferring them to the NSH after 
stabilising the patient.   
The following general principles were 
adhered to: 
x The GDG was consulted during the 
construction and interpretation of the 
models. 
x The sources of data are published 
studies and expert opinion. 
x Model assumptions were reported 
fully and transparently. 
x The results were subject to sensitivity 
analysis and limitations were discussed. 
x We followed the methods of the NICE 
reference case. Therefore costs were 
calculated from a health services 
perspective. Health gain was measured 
in terms of quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) gained. 
11.6.4.1 
General method 
The model is represented by a decision 
tree (Fig.2): once the ambulance crews 
arrive at the accident scene, the patient 
can be transported either to the nearest 
District General Hospital (DGH) or to a
