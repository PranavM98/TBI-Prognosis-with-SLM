Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
x they have sought to quantify and cost outcomes 1-3 only. For example, the studies did not 
measure the cost savings and health gain associated with early diagnosis. Stein et al suggested 
that for those patients who are not diagnosed early there are lost wages and increased costs 
relating to in-patient stay, rehabilitation, treatment, medication and orthotic devices. 
Additional evidence retrieved in 2007 can be found below in 11.3.7.

Cost-effectiveness model – imaging of the head 
Using the unit costs and frequencies of testing, the cost per patient of each strategy is shown in 
Table 11.6. The least cost strategy is the 5-point Canadian CT Head rule. Although the cost of CT 
scanning is higher than for the current (pre-2003) UK system, the extra cost is more than offset by 
the reduction in skull X-rays and admissions.

Both Canadian rules could save the NHS money. It would require investment in additional CT 
scanning facilities but these costs would, be offset by the freeing up of ward space and X-ray 
capacity. 
These results were largely insensitive to the unit costs and probabilities used (Table 11.7). Only 
when both costs and probabilities were set to favour the current (pre-2003) UK system was the 
Canadian seven point rule more costly.
