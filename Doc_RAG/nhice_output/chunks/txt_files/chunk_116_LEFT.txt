Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
update guideline specifically the peer 
reviewed publication of the validation 
phase of the Canadian cervical spine 
rules. 
For Children - 
[NEW] Children under 10 years of age 
with GCS of 8 or less should have CT 
imaging of the cervical spine within 1 
hour of presentation or when they are 
sufficiently stable. 
The recommendation is based on GDG 
opinion.

Using adult rules with infants and children 
The literature on cervical spine injury in 
infants and children has not to date 
produced highly sensitive and specific 
clinical decision rules based on level one 
evidence that can be used to select such 
patients for imaging cervical spine. 
There is evidence that the prevalence of 
spinal injuries in children and infants with 
head injury is much lower than in adults 
but to date no clearly defined rules with 
acceptable sensitivity and specificity 
have been produced.125,126 
In this update new clinical prediction 
rules for head imaging have been 
examined in children and have been 
recommended for the head. However no 
studies have investigated clinician 
prediction rules for the cervical spine in 
children, therefore no new 
recommendation is suggested for use in 
children.
