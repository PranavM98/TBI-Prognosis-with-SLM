Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
additional 845 patients selected that 
were excluded for the primary analysis. 
These patients were excluded as they 
were not tested on range of motion 
which is one of the criteria for the CCR 
prediction rule. Secondary analysis was 
conducted including these ‘indeterminate’ 
patients. 
The second prospective cohort study 
retrieved124 compared the CCR and 
physicians judgement. This study 
comprised 6265 adult patients in ten 
Canadian emergency departments who 
were in a stable and alert (GCS 15) 
condition and had neck pain or no neck 
pain but visible injury above the clavicle 
and were non-ambulatory and had a 
dangerous mechanism of injury. This 
population was from Phase 1 of the 
original derivation study for the CCR. 
Physician’s judgement was assessed to 
predict at least 0% probability of 
clinically important cervical spine injury. 
Patients received X-rays as requested 
by judgement of the treating physician 
or were followed up at 14 days by 
structured telephone interview. There 
were 64 (1%) clinically important 
cervical spine injuries detected. CCR had 
a higher sensitivity of 100% (95% CI, 
94-100) compared to physician 
judgement of 92.2% (95% CI, 94-100). 
Specificity was 44.0% (95% CI, 43-45) 
for CCR compared to 53.9% (95% CI, 
82-96) for physician judgement.
