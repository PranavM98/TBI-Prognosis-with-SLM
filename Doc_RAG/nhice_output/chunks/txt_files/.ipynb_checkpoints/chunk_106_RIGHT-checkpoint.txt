The outcome measures for included 
studies for this review were sensitivity 
and specificity of the imaging technique.

Clinical evidence  
We included one meta-analysis108 which 
compared plain X-rays with CT. This 
meta-analysis included seven diagnostic 
cohort studies. The studies varied in the 
number of views (3 and 5) and some 
were retrospective and others 
prospective. Another prospective 
diagnostic cohort study109 was also 
retrieved comparing 3 view X-ray with 
CT. The final prospective diagnostic 
cohort study110 compared helical CT and 
X-rays (single cross-table lateral). All 3 
studies were graded as diagnostic 
studies level II evidence. All these studies 
included patients over 16 years of age. 
We found no studies in children and 
infants. 
A meta-analysis108 was retrieved which 
included seven diagnostic cohort studies. 
This study comprised 3834 patients with 
blunt trauma events requiring imaging. 
The reference standard was either CT or 
all imaging scans and clinical follow-up. 
CT scans had a higher sensitivity of 98% 
(95% CI, 96-99) compared to X-rays 
which were 52% (95% CI, 47-56). The 
test for heterogeneity for the sensitivity 
of CT was 0.99 and for X-rays was 
0.07. As there was a high variation in
