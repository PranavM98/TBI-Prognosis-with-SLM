In the long-term, this should not represent 
an increase in cost to the NHS since 
patients and their treatment costs are 
merely being shifted from one hospital 
to another. Furthermore we have no 
reason to believe that ITU costs are 
higher at the NSH; indeed according to 
the 2006 Reference Costs177, the cost of 
a bed in a neurosurgical ITU is lower 
than the cost of a bed in a general ITU. 
Hence we did not include ITU costs in our 
base case analysis. 
In the short-term, the resource impact is 
less clear and will depend on local 
circumstances. A DGH might not achieve 
the full cost savings from seeing fewer 
patients as typically it would be losing 
only Â¼ of an ITU bed. However, staff 
costs and consumables would be redeployed almost immediately. The bed 
could also be re-deployed if there is 
currently under-capacity. If so more 
patients would be treated in ITU as a 
result of the increased capacity at DGHs 
but this would not necessarily produce a 
reduction in costs to the Trust.  However, 
this increase in ITU capacity could lead 
to cost savings from reduced transfers. 
To implement a direct transport strategy, 
NSH units will need to invest in extra ITU 
beds. This will be offset by cost savings 
at DGHs. However the cost savings will 
not necessarily offset the cost fully in the 
short-term. The implementation costs 
associated with shifting patients will 
have to be taken in to account in any 
cost impact analysis conducted for the 
purposes of implementation.
