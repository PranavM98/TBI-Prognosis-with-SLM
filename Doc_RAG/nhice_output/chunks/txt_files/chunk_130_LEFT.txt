Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
surgical lesions, and suffer morbidity 
and mortality equal to those with 
surgical lesions. Further, several studies 
provide strong circumstantial evidence 
that managing such “non-surgical” 
patients in specialist neurosciences 
centres may result in substantial 
improvements in mortality and functional 
outcome, probably due to specialist 
expertise in areas of non-operative 
management, such as neurocritical care. 
However, these results may be 
confounded by case-mix effects and 
referral bias, and the cost-effectiveness 
of such specialist management remains 
uncertain. There is a strong case to 
address this question in the context of a 
formal study, since a change in practice 
could have a major impact on death and 
disability in a condition that is a major 
contributor to mortality in healthy young 
adults.  Importantly, the results of such a 
study could fundamentally alter the 
recommendations made by NICE, in 
terms of where patients with head injury 
are treated within the healthcare system, 
and result in better optimised (and 
potentially more cost-effective) patient 
flows within the NHS. 
The available evidence in this area has 
been addressed in the systematic review 
that contributed to the revision of NICE 
Guidelines on the early management of 
head injury. This review could find no 
high quality clinical evidence on the 
topic. This is unsurprising, since any study 
that addressed these issues would have 
to be undertaken within the context of a 
healthcare system and include 
ambulance services, district general 
hospitals and neuroscience referral 
centres. Such a study would therefore
