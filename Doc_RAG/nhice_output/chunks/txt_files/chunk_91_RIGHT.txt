6.3.4 
Summary of evidence from 2007 
update 
The evidence is relatively weak as the 
Halley et al75 study  included a limited 
sample size with 9 out of the 98 subjects 
not being contactable.  
A decision model76 estimated that CT 
scanning all patients was more effective 
and cost saving than x-raying all 
patients. It also showed that selective CT 
scanning could be just as effective as 
routine CT with lower cost (see also 6.5). 
However, the setting was the USA where 
costs are quite different to the NHS and 
the estimates of effectiveness were 
derived from case series. 
6.3.5 
Rationale behind recommendation 
Generally speaking, CT is more sensitive 
than x-ray at detecting clinically 
important lesions, although evidence 
specific to head trauma was not 
retrieved.  CT is likely to be costeffective but only if a) the extra lesions 
found by CT pose a significant health 
risk, b) identification leads to 
earlier/better treatment and c) 
early/modified treatment improves 
survival.  For these variables there is no 
high quality evidence.  However, a 
decision model76 based on case series 
evidence estimated that CT scanning all 
patients would be more effective and 
cost saving than x-raying all patients in 
a US context.  
The GDG felt based on their expertise 
that CT is the most appropriate tool for 
diagnosing life-threatening conditions 
resulting from head injury. The GDG 
also felt that a recommendation was 
required to emphasize that x-ray is not
