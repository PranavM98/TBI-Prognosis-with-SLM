though this is currently unquantified â€“ 
clinical judgement should be used to 
assess the need for an urgent scan in 
these patients.

the risk factors above should have 
their CT imaging performed within 8 
hours of the injury (imaging should be 
performed immediately in these 
patients if they present 8 hours or

consciousness or amnesia has been 
experienced. 
These recommendations are based on

The demands on X-ray facilities are not

there is no consequent need to
