Cancer risks 
The risk of radiation-induced 
malignancies from a single CT exposure 
is difficult to assess.  There have been no 
published epidemiological studies of 
increased incidence of cancer among CT 
exposed patients. Current estimates of 
the risks from medical X-rays are based 
on  the long term follow up of 
populations exposed to large doses of 
radiation.168 The 1990 recommendations 
of the International Commission on 
Radiological Protection (ICRP) report a 
nominal probability coefficient of 5% 
per Sv effective dose for the lifetime risk 
of fatal cancer in a population of all 
ages and both sexes exposed to 
radiation at the relatively low doses 
used in CT examinations. 169   
The lifetime fatal cancer risk will vary 
with age at exposure and sex and the 
way that it does so varies from organ to 
organ. As a rough guide, assuming 
uniform whole body irradiation, the 
NRPB estimates that the lifetime risk for 
radiation-induced cancer per unit dose is 
about twice as high in children (0-15 
years old) than in adults (20-60 years 
old)170. This would put the lifetime risk of 
fatal cancer following exposures in 
childhood at about 10% per Sv 
effective dose, compared to about 5% 
per Sv for exposures to adults between 
20 and 60 years old.  The risks drop 
dramatically at ages above 60 years 
due mostly to the reduced lifetime 
available in which these delayed effects 
of radiation can occur. 
More specifically, Brenner et al 
estimated that the lifetime cancer
