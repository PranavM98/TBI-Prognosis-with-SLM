the guideline development process 
would be defined as â€˜clinically important 
brain injury'. It was agreed that need 
for neurosurgery was too limited a 
definition, given that operation is not 
appropriate for some patients and the 
guideline scope calls for some means for 
the early identification of those patients 
that might benefit from 
neurorehabilitation. This deliberately 
broad definition of outcome also reflects 
the heterogeneity of brain injuries that 
may be experienced following head 
trauma.

Systematic reviews 
The systematic reviews performed for 
these guidelines were designed to 
identify different types of clinical 
decision rule. The studies reviewed 
included derivation designs (usually 
cohort studies where the predictive 
power of a number of prognostic 
variables were explored) and validation 
designs (where the sensitivity and 
specificity of previously defined rules 
were examined).  Data collection may 
have been prospective or retrospective. 
The follow-up rate for important 
outcomes was also recorded: a standard 
of at least 80% follow-up is often stated 
for studies on the development of clinical 
decision rules. The use of multivariate 
statistics to identify the independent 
contribution of each variable to the rules
