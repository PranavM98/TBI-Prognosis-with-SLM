Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults.

Admission and observation
9.1 
Introduction 
These guidelines place the emphasis on 
the early diagnosis of clinically 
important brain and cervical spine 
injuries, using a sensitive and specific 
clinical decision rule with early imaging. 
Admission to hospital is intrinsically 
linked to imaging results, on the basis 
that patients who do not require imaging 
are safe for discharge to the community 
(given that no other reasons for 
admission exist) and those who do 
require imaging can be discharged 
following negative imaging (again, 
given that no other reasons for 
admission exist). However, observation 
of patients will still form an important 
part of the acute management phase, 
for patients with abnormal CT results 
that do not require surgery and/or for 
patients with unresolved neurological 
signs.  Observation should occur 
throughout the patientâ€™s hospital 
episode, whether in the emergency 
department or after admission following 
abnormal imaging results. As noted 
above, all care professionals should use 
a standard head injury proforma in their 
documentation when assessing and 
observing patients with head injury.  
Separate adult, and child/infant specific 
proformas should be used. Again, the
