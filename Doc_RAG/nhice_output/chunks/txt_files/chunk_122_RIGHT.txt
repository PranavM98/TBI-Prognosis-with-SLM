been accepted by UK neurosurgeons, 
and a survey carried out in 2003 by the 
Society of British Neurological Surgeons 
found substantial concern about the 
Canadian criteria.  The UK survey was 
carried out specifically to complement 
the development of this guideline. It 
would be desirable if the criteria to be 
used in this area could be based on the 
opinion of UK neurosurgeons. 
7.4.1 
Recommendations for research 
The GDG identified the following 
priority areas for research in the 
original guideline as well as in this 
update. 
7.4.1.1 
Research Question 
Research is needed to develop consensus 
on criteria for lesions not currently 
considered to be surgically significant 
following imaging of a patient with 
head injury. 
Although most neurosurgeons agree 
about which extradural and subdural 
haematomas should be removed, there is 
controversy about whether or not to 
remove traumatic intracerebral 
haemorrhage (TICH) and cerebral 
contusions (CC). A prospective 
randomised controlled trial (PRCT) 
should be set up to discover if early 
surgery improves the outcome in these 
lesions compared to initial conservative 
treatment. 
7.4.1.2 Why this research is important 
One option in the management of 
traumatic intracerebral haemorrhage 
(TICH) and cerebral contusions (CC) is to
