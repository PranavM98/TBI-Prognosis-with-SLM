Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
trauma) is a more important risk factor.25 
Amnesia is a less useful predictor 
variable in infants and young children, 
simply because it is difficult to measure. 
4.4 
Neurological signs 
Post-traumatic neurological signs such as 
focal neurological deficits or seizure are 
highly associated with the risk of an 
intracranial complication47 and the risk is 
so large that these patients are 
commonly excluded from studies 
developing clinical decision rules for the 
management of acute head injury.   
4.5 
Bleeding disorders and use of 
anticoagulants 
Patients with coagulopathy have an 
elevated risk of intracranial 
complications but the exact strength of 
this relationship has not been 
established.48,49 
4.6 
Skull fracture 
It is accepted that the risk of intracranial 
complications is higher in patients with a 
diagnosis of skull fracture. It can be 
estimated that the risk of developing an 
intracranial haematoma is about 12 
times higher in patients with a 
radiographically detected skull fracture 
than in patients without this diagnosis, 
based on an estimate of 38% sensitivity 
and 95% specificity produced by a 
meta-analysis of the value of the 
radiological diagnosis of skull fracture.23 
There is variation in diagnostic practice 
for skull fracture. Some guidelines 
advocate the use of skull X-ray in the 
diagnosis of skull fracture,13 while others 
advocate the use of signs alone (for 
example, cerebrospinal fluid leak,
