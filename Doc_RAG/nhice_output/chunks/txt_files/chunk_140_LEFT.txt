Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
- Patients with new, clinically 
significant abnormalities on imaging. 
- Patients who have not returned to 
GCS equal to 15 after imaging, 
regardless of the imaging results. 
- When a patient fulfils the criteria for 
CT scanning but this cannot be done 
within the appropriate period, either 
because CT is not available or because 
the patient is not sufficiently 
cooperative to allow scanning. 
- Continuing worrying signs (for 
example, persistent vomiting, severe 
headaches) of concern to the clinician. 
- Other sources of concern to the 
clinician (for example, drug or alcohol 
intoxication, other injuries, shock, 
suspected non-accidental injury, 
meningism, cerebrospinal fluid leak). 
[Amended] Some patients may require 
an extended period in a recovery 
setting because of the use of general 
anaesthesia during CT imaging.  
Patients with multiple injuries should 
be admitted under the care of the team 
that is trained to deal with their most 
severe and urgent problem. 
These recommendations are based on 
level five evidence and are considered 
to be grade D recommendations.

Good practice in observation of patients 
with head injury 
There is some evidence that Emergency 
Deparment observation wards are more 
efficient than general acute wards at 
dealing with short stay observation
