cannot be quantified using currently 
available data â€“ notably those 
associated with the impact of radiation 
exposure. 
Table 11.12 (below) summarises the 
estimated changes in imaging and 
admission volumes and cost in England 
and Wales as a result of these 
guidelines. This is based on Tables 11.3, 
11.6 and 11.10 and assumes an 
incidence of 700,000 head injury 
attendees to emergency departments 
per year. 
We would like to emphasise the 
tentativeness of these estimates. There is 
uncertainty over these figures for a 
number of reasons. Data were taken 
from four different sources to estimate 
the number of scans (currently and with 
the new system). 25,52,122,176  Various 
assumptions had to be made to make 
the denominator of the estimates from 
these studies comparable. Some of the 
evidence was not from a UK population. 
Empirical studies found in the 2007 
update (Table 11.9) show great 
variation between centres and therefore 
help little to reduce the uncertainty 
about the numbers of each scan before 
and after the guideline. 
The reduction in skull X-rays is likely to 
be an overestimate, as some skull X-rays 
may still have to take place for nonaccidental injuries and other reasons. 
The reduction in in-patient observation is 
also uncertain. This assumes that 
clinicians are able to discharge patients 
who have had a negative CT scan. This 
will not be the case for patients who
