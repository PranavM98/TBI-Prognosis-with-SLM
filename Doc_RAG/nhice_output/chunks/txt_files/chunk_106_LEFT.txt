Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
fractures are associated with vertebral 
artery injury which may be detected by 
MRI.107 
6.6.1.5 Occipital condyle injuries 
Occipital condylar fractures are 
uncommon injuries associated with high 
energy blunt trauma to the head and/or 
upper cervical spine. They are difficult 
to diagnose clinically but should be 
suspected in patients showing signs of 
lower cranial nerve palsy after injury. 
Demonstration on plain films is extremely 
difficult and radiological diagnosis 
requires good quality CT. 
6.7 
What is the best diagnostic imaging 
technique to determine which patients 
have sustained damage to the cervical 
spine and require further assessment of 
cervical spine 
6.7.1 
Introduction and rationale for the 
clinical question 
Given the potentially devastating 
consequences of a missed cervical spine 
injury, timely and accurate diagnosis is 
essential for optimal management. This 
review is required to identify which of 
the currently available tools is best to 
identify clinically important cervical 
spine injury.  
The population group was patients with 
head injury and suspected cervical spine 
injury. The intervention/imaging options 
were: 
x Computed Tomography Scan (CT) 
x Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
