40% of the collective dose to the

had risen to 7% and 47% 
respectively.160         
National patient dose surveys for CT 
examinations have been carried out in 
the UK in 1989161 and in 2003162. Both 
surveys show significant variations in 
patient dose across the country for the 
same CT examination, by factors of 10 
to 40, due to differences in scanner 
design and institutional-specific 
examination techniques. There 
consequently still appears to be 
considerable scope for standardising 
examination techniques to protect the 
patient from unnecessary exposure 
without reduction in image quality. 
Patient doses were generally lower by 
10-40% in the 2003 survey compared 
to 1989. Lowering patient dose is 
possible with adjustments of scan 
technique, tube current and filtration 
factors, alterations in pitch, and image 
reconstruction parameters163-165. 
Increased awareness of these dosereduction techniques has probably led to 
better-optimised scan protocols being 
used in the later survey. Automatic tube
