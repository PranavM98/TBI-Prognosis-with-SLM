Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
UK as a whole has been quoted6 but this 
may be slightly higher than is the case. 
Hospital Episode Statistics data for the 
2000/2001 annual dataset indicate 
that 398 patients in England underwent 
an operation to drain the extradural 
space (OPCS code A40) and 2,048 
patients underwent an operation to 
drain the subdural space (OPCS code 
A41)7.These figures do not include a 
small number of other neurosurgical 
procedures possible after head injury, 
and include some patients with a nonhead injury diagnosis. Thus, the routine 
data available does not allow for a 
precise estimate of neurosurgical volume 
after head injury for England and 
Wales, but points to a figure in the low 
thousands. 
Although the incidence of head injury is 
high, the incidence of death from head 
injury is low (6-10 per 100,000 
population per annum).5 As few as 0.2% 
of all patients attending emergency 
departments with a head injury will die 
as a result of this injury.7,8Ninety per 
cent of all people who have sustained a 
head injury will present with a minor or 
mild injury (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] 
greater than 12) but the majority of 
fatal outcomes will be in the moderate 
(GCS of 9 to 12) or severe (GCS less 
than or equal to 8) head injury groups 
which account for only 10% of 
attenders.9 Therefore emergency 
departments are required to see a large 
number of patients with a minor/mild 
head injury, and identify the very small 
number of these that will go on to have 
serious acute intracranial complications.
