Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
x difficulties for hospitals in transferring 
patients for specialist care, especially 
for neurosurgery (stabilisation of patient 
first, co-ordination between the first 
hospital and the specialist hospital and 
consequent long delays).  
Methods 
A modelling of the flow of trauma 
patients was carried out to determine 
the best trauma service configuration for 
adult trauma patients with severe injury 
in the London area. The model was 
designed to estimate the time from injury 
x Critical Intervention (urgent life saving 
interventions such as intubation); these 
interventions are crucial for all trauma 
patients 
x Definitive Intervention (specialist 
interventions such as neurosurgery); these 
interventions vary according to the site 
of the trauma 
The specific aims of the modelling 
exercise were to evaluate the effect on 
time to intervention of: 
(a) different bypass strategies  
(b) improving the current system by 
reducing time taken in pre-hospital and 
in-hospital trauma management. 
(c) a doctor in the pre-hospital phase 
provided by the London Helicopter 
Emergency Medical Service (HEMS). 
The model simulated results based on 
about 10,000 actual severe injuries from 
the London region.  Of these 33% had 
isolated head injury and a further 18% 
had non-isolated head injury.
