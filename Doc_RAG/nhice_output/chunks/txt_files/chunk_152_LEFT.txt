Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults.

These strategies were designed to find 
any economic study related to head 
injury. Abstracts and database reviews 
of papers found were reviewed by the 
health economist and were discarded if 
they appeared not to contain any 
economic data or if the focus of the 
paper was not imaging after trauma.  
Relevant references in the 
bibliographies of reviewed papers were 
also identified and reviewed. 
11.2.2 
Modelling of cost-effectiveness â€“ 
intracranial haematoma 
A cost analysis was performed for the 
use of CT scanning on patients who have 
minor/mild head injury (that is, GCS 
greater than 12) but some loss of 
consciousness or amnesia at the time of 
the impact or thereafter. The reason for 
selecting this group is that it is assumed 
that those patients with a more 
significant loss of consciousness receive 
CT scanning automatically or are 
referred to neurosurgery. It is assumed 
that those who do not experience loss of 
consciousness or amnesia will not receive 
CT scanning. These assumptions mirror 
the methods used to derive the 
Canadian CT-head rule. 
Four alternative strategies were selected 
for the model (Table 11.1). The first is 
an approximation of the current (pre2003) UK system, based on skull X-ray 
for patients who have experienced loss 
of consciousness or amnesia. The second 
and third are the Canadian head rules, 
which avoid skull X-ray, but allow
