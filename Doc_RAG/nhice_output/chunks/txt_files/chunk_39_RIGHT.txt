Systematic review of means of identifying 
patients at high risk of late sequelae 
following head injury 
This systematic review aimed to identify 
clinical decision rules that could be used 
to select patients who are at high risk of 
late sequelae following head injury, and 
who therefore should be followed up so 
that potential long term problems can be 
identified. 
The original search for CT algorithms for 
the identification of prognostic variables 
for intracranial haematoma produced 
1454 abstracts in MEDLINE and 680 
abstracts in EMBASE (after duplicates 
with MEDLINE were excluded). This full 
abstract list was reviewed to look for 
papers that may be of relevance to 
disability. After this a search was 
performed on Medline and Embase, 
listed in Appendix 1 for prognosis of 
minor/mild head injury. Experts were 
also contacted for relevant papers. The 
search of the 1454 abstracts revealed 
152 potentially interesting papers. The 
additional MEDLINE and EMBASE search 
revealed 48 papers not previously seen 
of which eight abstracts looked to be of 
relevance. Experts provided three useful 
papers.  These abstracts were then 
independently read by two reviewers to 
identify those papers that should be 
obtained and read in full. At this point 
the only criteria used was the likelihood 
that the paper might describe a rule or 
provide factors in the acute assessment 
of the patient that might predict postconcussional syndrome. After this 
assessment 23 papers were selected for 
review
