provision of beds, etc. Perhaps we 
should be recommending that bypass 
strategies are developed at a regional 
level to take into account local service 
configurations. 
11.6.4.9 Direct transport model: Conclusions 
x A simulation model and some 
empirical studies have shown reduced 
mortality associated with directly 
transporting patients with serious head 
injury to an NSH. 
x If ambulance crews can assess patients 
accurately then a policy of direct 
transport to an NSH is likely to produce 
a net cost saving to emergency 
department services (because of the 
resources involved with stabilising and 
transferring patients).   
x Long term care costs might increase or 
decrease depending on the extent that 
health status (quality of life) is improved 
by direct transport. 
x We found that even with conservative 
estimates about long term care costs, 
direct transport is likely to be costeffective in spite of the very high costs 
of caring for patients with severe 
disability.   
x If ambulance crews (unintentionally) 
overestimate the number of patients to 
be treated in the Neurosciences Centre, 
some patients will experience journeys 
that are longer than necessary and may 
incur complicationsâ€“ in which case health 
gain might be decreased and costs 
increased for these patients.
