4.18 
Training in risk assessment 
There is some evidence that ambulance 
crews using written triage guidelines in a 
United States context may fall short of 
acceptable levels of triage accuracy.58 
The GDG is under the impression that 
the triage skills of other community 
professionals may sometimes be below a 
desirable standard. 
[Amended] It is recommended that 
General Practitioners, nurses, dentists 
and ambulance crews should receive 
training, as necessary, to ensure that 
they are capable of assessing the 
presence or absence of the risk factors 
listed in section 4.16.   
This recommendation is based on level 
five evidence and is considered to be a 
grade D recommendation.
