Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
specialist wards by nurses and doctors 
not experienced in neurological 
observation. In 1999 The Royal College 
of Surgeons of England surveyed 
General Surgeons in the UK and found 
that although 56% of Consultants 
observed patients with head injury on 
their wards, only 48% had any 
neurological experience and 34% were 
dissatisfied with this referral process. 
The Royal College advised that patients 
with head injury should not be observed 
in non-specialist wards,12 but it is unclear 
whether this has resulted in an increased 
proportion of patients with head injury 
being observed in appropriately staffed 
wards.

Morbidity 
The incidence of morbidity after head 
injury is higher than had been previously 
appreciated33 and far exceeds the 
capacity of UK neurorehabilitation 
services. In a study of head injury 
admissions in 1995/96 in Glasgow, 
47% of patients followed up for one 
year after discharge had survived with 
some form of restriction to lifestyle. 
Surprisingly, the proportion of patients 
experiencing the most serious sequelae 
(that is, moderate or severe), did not 
vary according to the severity of the 
initial injury. The study found that 47% 
of patients admitted with apparently 
minor/mild head injuries experienced 
significant sequelae on follow-up, 
compared to 45% of patients admitted 
for moderate head injury, and 48% of 
patients admitted for severe head 
injury. Only 47% of survivors with 
sequelae were seen in hospital after 
discharge and only 28% received some
