multiplanar reformatted images 
generated rapidly. Facilities for 
multiplanar reformatting and 
interactive viewing should be 
available. (B) 
3.5.5.4 
MRI is indicated in the presence of 
neurological signs and symptoms 
referable to the cervical spine and if 
there is suspicion of vascular injury 
(for example, subluxation or 
displacement of the spinal column, 
fracture through foramen 
transversarium or lateral processes, 
posterior circulation syndromes). (B) 
3.5.5.5 
MRI may add important information 
about soft tissue injuries associated 
with bony injuries demonstrated by 
plain films and/or CT. (B) 
3.5.5.6 
MRI has a role in the assessment of 
ligamentous and disc injuries 
suggested by plain films, CT or clinical 
findings. (B) 
3.5.5.7 
In CT, the occipital condyle region 
should be routinely reviewed on 'bone 
windows' for patients who have 
sustained a head injury.  
Reconstruction of standard head 
images onto a high resolution bony 
algorithm is readily achieved with 
modern CT scanners.(B) 
3.5.5.8 
In patients who have sustained high 
energy trauma or are showing signs of 
lower cranial nerve palsy, particular 
attention should be paid to the region 
of the foramen magnum. If necessary, 
additional high resolution imaging for 
coronal and sagittal reformatting 
should be performed while the patient 
is on the scanner table.(B)
