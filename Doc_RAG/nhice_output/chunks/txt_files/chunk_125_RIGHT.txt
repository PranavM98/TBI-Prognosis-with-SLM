(n=1333 (48.2%)) were transferred to 
an area/non trauma centre. These 
patients were assessed via the American 
Triage system (pre hospital care) and 
referred directly to either an area 
centre or a non trauma centre. The 
mortality for transfer to regional centre 
versus non trauma centre was OR of 
0.67 (95% CI, 0.53-0.85). 
In another study135, a low quality study 
(level 3 evidence), where patients were 
directly transported to neurosurgical 
care or secondarily transferred from a 
DGH, the population group were 
neurosurgical unit patients with an 
extradural haematoma requiring 
surgery (n=104). Group 1 patients 
(n=71) had a mean age of 22 years 
(±2SE) were directly transported to a 
neurosurgical centre. Group 2 patients 
(n=33) had a mean age 20years (±3SE) 
and were transferred from the DGH to 
a neurosurgical centre. The results using 
the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) 
show that mortality in group 1 was 4% 
(3/71) and in group 2 was 24% (8/33). 
The moderate/severe disability in group 
1 was 10% (7/71) and group 2 was 
27% (9/33). Recovery was good in 
86% (61/71) of group 1 patients and 
49% (16/33) in group 2, with 
p0.0002. 
The final study136 was a well designed 
cohort study (level 2++ evidence) 
looking at mortality outcomes between 
patients directly transferred to a trauma 
centre and those who were transferred 
first to a non-trauma centre, and then on 
to a trauma centre. This cohort study 
included severely traumatic brain injured 
patients. The data was collected as part 
of a multi-centre online database
