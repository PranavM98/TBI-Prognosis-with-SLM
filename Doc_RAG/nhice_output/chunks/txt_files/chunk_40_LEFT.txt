Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
A brief description of the rule proposed 
was extracted. Only one paper actually 
proposed a rule. Participant description 
focused on GCS levels, age, and the 
main inclusion and exclusion criteria. The 
outcome measures used were extracted. 
The definitions of long term disability or 
post-concussive were heterogeneous. 
Data on specificity and sensitivity were 
recorded where possible. As only one 
paper provided a rule, these figures 
could only be calculated for this one 
paper. The prevalence of important 
outcomes was also recorded. A previous 
systematic review was also available to 
the project team and this informed the 
review.

Systematic review of medical radiation 
This review aimed to provide simple 
estimates of the radiation risks 
associated with CT of the head. The 
search produced 654 abstracts in 
MEDLINE and 260 in EMBASE (after 
duplicates had been removed). A search 
using the Google search engine 
revealed useful documents from the 
United Nations Scientific Committee on 
the Effects of Atomic Radiation 
(UNSCEAR) and the National 
Radiological Protection Board (NRPB).  
Personal communications with the 
National Radiological Protection Board 
also provided papers and data which 
contributed to the review. Following 
abstract review and including the 
papers supplied by experts, 80 full 
articles were obtained and were 
reviewed to determine relevance. This 
identified 16 documents considered of
