require the organisational backing of a 
body such as NICE and careful design to 
account for confounds and biases. 
However, we believe that given careful 
design, such a study would be both 
ethically and logistically feasible. The 
patient group is well defined, and 
adequate numbers would be available 
to provide a definitive result within a 
reasonable time frame. While 
circumstantial evidence may support 
transfer of such patients to neurosciences 
centres, current practice is not influenced 
by this view in many regions, and many 
would argue that there is still clinical 
equipoise in this area. There are clear 
risks from transfer, and there could be 
clear harm, both in terms of clinical 
outcome and health economics, if the 
anticipated benefits were not realised. 
On the other hand, if the benefits from 
observational studies were confirmed by 
the trial, the resulting changes in 
management could potentially reduce 
case-mix adjusted mortality by 26% 
and increase the incidence of favourable 
outcome in survivors by nearly 20%.
