Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
hours practice, which may push up the 
unit cost of scanning. The shortage of 
radiology and radiography staff, 
especially those with appropriate 
experience in CT scanning of the head, 
may again mean that the real cost of 
increasing CT scanning is greater than 
our calculations would suggest or at 
least that implementation will have to be 
delayed. 
One issue raised throughout the 
guideline consensus process was the 
need for additional staff training at 
many levels. Achieving this goal, 
nationally, could require substantial 
resources, especially when shortages in 
specialist staff (for example, 
radiographers) are already constraining 
the system.194 
We have suggested a number of 
reasons in the guideline document why 
the cost savings we have predicted 
might not occur. These include: 
x in-patient observation may not be 
reduced despite the increase in CT 
scanning (evidence since 2003 is mixed 
– see Table 11.9);   
x cervical spine CT might be quite rare 
at present and therefore the reductions 
won’t take place; 
x some skull X-rays will still have to take 
place for penetrating injury and other 
reasons (for example, suspected nonaccidental injury); 
x we have postulated that the similarity 
between the NEXUS guidelines and 
those of the RCR suggests that the 
NEXUS study represents current practice
