Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
monitor the patient clinically or with 
intracranial pressure monitoring and 
other forms of brain tissue monitoring 
such as brain tissue oxygen (BtO2) or 
microdialysis. When the patient 
deteriorates, he or she is rushed to the 
operating theatre. The problem is that 
this approach has never been validated 
in a prospective randomised controlled 
trial (PRCT). Waiting until there is 
deterioration in the level of consciousness 
(LOC) or until there is deterioration in 
the monitoring parameters builds delay 
into the management and results in 
secondary brain damage occurring and 
becoming established before surgery in 
all such cases. The principle of early 
surgical evacuation of spontaneous 
intracerebral haemorrhage (SICH) has 
been investigated in the surgical trial in 
intracerebral haemorrhage (STICH) and 
reported in the Lancet (2005). The 
results of such a PRCT in TICH would 
fundamentally alter the 
recommendations made by NICE, in 
terms of which patients should be 
referred to neurosurgery and, more 
importantly, how they should be 
managed there. There is no level 1 
evidence about what to do with these 
patients and the need for such a PRCT in 
head injured patients is urgent. This 
research question should immediately be 
put to UK Research Funding bodies.
