loss of consciousness, definite amnesia or 
witnessed disorientation, a GCS score of 
13 or greater and injury within the 
previous 24 hours. The Canadian CT 
head rule (CCHR) was compared to the 
New Orleans Criteria (NOC). There 
were 97 patients (5.3%) with clinically 
important brain injury and 8 patients 
(0.4%) required neurosurgical 
intervention. For detecting clinically 
important brain injury both rules had 
100% (95% CI, 96% to 100%) 
sensitivity but the Canadian CT head 
rule had a higher specificity of 50.6% 
(95% CI, 48%to 53%) than NOC 12.7% 
(95% CI, 11% to 14%). The reference 
standard was the CT scan. 
The second study was a prospective 
cohort study (diagnostic study level II 
evidence) by Smits et al84 comprising 
3181 Dutch patients with blunt head 
injury and compared the NOC and 
CCHR rules. The inclusion criteria were 
patients age older than 16 years, GCS 
of 13 to 14 and presentation within 24 
hours. Patients with a GCS score of 15 
were included if they had one of the 
following risk factors; history of loss of 
consciousness, short-term memory deficit, 
amnesia for traumatic event, 
posttraumatic seizure, vomiting, severe 
headache, clinical evidence of 
intoxication, use of anticoagulants, 
physical evidence of injury above 
clavicles or neurological deficit.  
The prevalence of neurocranial 
traumatic CT findings was 9.8% and the 
incidence of neurosurgical intervention 
was 0.5%. The CT scan was used as the 
reference standard. For neurosurgical 
intervention both rules had 100% (95%
