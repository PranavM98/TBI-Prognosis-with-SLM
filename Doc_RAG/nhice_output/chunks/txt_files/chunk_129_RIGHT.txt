improved clinical outcomes when 
compared to similar patients who are 
treated in non-specialist centres?  
7.9.1.2 
Why this research is important 
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is amongst 
the most important causes of death in 
young adults, with an overall mortality 
for severe TBI of over 50%. TBI care 
consumes one million acute hospital beddays, and over 15,000 ICU bed-days 
annually, and patients who do survive 
significant TBI experience an enormous 
burden of long term physical disability, 
neurocognitive deficits, and 
neuropsychiatric sequelae. The financial 
impact is significant: the NHS spends 
over Â£1 billion on just the acute hospital 
care of the 10,000 patients with 
significant TBI. The costs of rehabilitation 
and community care are difficult to 
estimate, but probably total many 
multiples of the figure provided for 
acute care. These considerations make 
TBI a national healthcare priority and its 
outcome impact is consistent with its 
inclusion in the National Service 
Framework for Long Term Neurological 
Conditions. 
Current referral of patients with acute 
traumatic brain injury practice is still 
dominated in many parts of the United 
Kingdom by the need for operative 
neurosurgical intervention at 
presentation. This may be inappropriate, 
since many patients with severe head 
injury have evidence of raised 
intracranial pressure in the absence of
