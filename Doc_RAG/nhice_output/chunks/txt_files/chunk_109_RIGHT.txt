attention should be paid to the region 
of the foramen magnum. If necessary, 
additional high resolution imaging for 
coronal and sagittal reformatting 
should be performed while the patient 
is on the scanner table. 
These recommendations are based on 
level three evidence and are 
considered to be grade B 
recommendations.

Cervical spine imaging of Infants and 
children 
6.8.1 
Recommendation 
Children aged 10 years or more can be 
treated as adults for the purposes of 
cervical spine imaging.  
It is recognised that physical 
examination of an immobilised, 
distressed child can be extremely 
difficult. Based on consensus the 
following recommendations were 
formulated by the Guideline 
Development Group: 
Children under 10 years should 
receive anterior/posterior and lateral 
plain films without an 
anterior/posterior peg view.  
This recommendation is based on level 
five evidence and is considered to be a 
grade D recommendation. 
[NEW] In children under 10 years,

associated with irradiation, 
particularly to the thyroid gland, and 
the generally lower risk of significant 
spinal injury, CT of the cervical spine 
should be used only in cases where
