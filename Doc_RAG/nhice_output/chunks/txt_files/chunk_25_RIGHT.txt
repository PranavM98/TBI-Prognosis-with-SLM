In the UK, controversy over guidelines 
for head injury centres on whether 
increased CT scanning is feasible or 
advisable, but in the USA the discussion 
is exactly the reverse. Research in the 
USA is directed towards attempts to 
reduce the very large numbers of CT 
scans being performed.23-25

The skull radiograph 
Historically, in the absence of readily 
available CT scanning resources, skull Xray was used to categorise patients with 
minor/mild head injuries into high and 
low risk groups. Previously in the UK up 
to 74% of all patients attending 
emergency departments with a head 
injury received a skull X-ray,although 
only about 2% of these X-rays will show 
a fracture26,27. 
An elevation of risk following positive 
skull X-ray is widely acknowledged and 
supported by UK evidence.17 A recent 
meta-analysis of thirteen studies where 
at least 50% of the sample underwent 
CT was performed. The meta-analysis 
contained almost 13,000 patients who 
had recently sustained a head injury. A 
weighted mean prevalence of 
intracranial haemorrhage of 0.083 
(95% CI: 0.03-0.13) was observed. The 
meta-analysis found that the sensitivity 
and specificity of a skull X-ray for 
predicting the presence of intracranial 
haemorrhage were 38% and 95% 
respectively.23  The equivalent predictive 
values were 0.41 (positive predictive 
value) and 0.94 (negative predictive 
value). These figures imply that if there 
is a skull fracture diagnosed on 
radiography, the risk of an intracranial 
haemorrhage is elevated (about 4.9
