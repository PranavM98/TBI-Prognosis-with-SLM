Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
patients have a severe head injury 
(GCS Â” 8), or where there is a strong 
clinical suspicion of injury despite 
normal plain films (for example, focal 
neurological signs or paraesthesia in 
the extremities), or where plain films 
are technically difficult or inadequate. 
This recommendation is based on GDG 
opinion and evidence on risks of 
irradiation (see 10).

The best clinical prediction rule for 
selecting patients that have sustained 
damage to the cervical spine for the 
imaging technique selected in section 6.7? 
6.9.1 
Introduction and rationale for the 
clinical question 
In order to improve the efficiency of the 
management of cervical spine injury, 
clinical prediction rules can be applied. 
A clinical prediction rule is derived from 
original research and is defined as a 
decisional making tool that incorporates 
three or more variables from the history, 
examination or simple tests25,80,81. This 
review was carried out to examine which 
clinical prediction rule was the best for 
determining which patients should 
undergo CT of the cervical spine. This 
question was deemed important as 
emerging evidence shows that the 
current practice of using plain films is not 
always reliable in identifying clinically 
important injuries to the cervical spine. 
This is particularly true in patients with 
severe head injury in whom assessment is 
more difficult. The interventions included 
within the studies were any prediction 
rule ranging from NEXUS, NOC, CCR 
and any other new rules. The outcomes
