information for alternative patient 
management strategies.172 In the UK, the 
remit of NICE is to produce national 
clinical guidelines that address costeffectiveness as well as clinical 
effectiveness. 
The reasoning behind the application of 
economic criteria to clinical guidelines is

world has enough resources to provide 
every potentially beneficial 
preventative, diagnostic, curative and 
palliative procedure. Therefore, there is 
a need to re-deploy resources to those 
procedures where the potential health 
gain is greatest. This requires 
abandoning practices that are relatively

money) of different healthcare
