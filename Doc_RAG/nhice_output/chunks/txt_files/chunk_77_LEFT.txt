Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
following criteria as high risk factors for 
clinically important brain injuries after 
head injury: pedestrian struck by motor 
vehicle, occupant ejected from motor 
vehicle, or a fall from a height of 
greater than three feet or more than 
five stairs25. A further study has defined 
‘axial load to head’ as a high risk factor 
for cervical spine injury after an 
accident19,52. This covers the following 
areas: diving; high-speed motor vehicle 
collision; rollover motor accident; 
ejection from a motor vehicle; accident 
involving motorized recreational 
vehicles; bicycle collision. In addition, 
there are many other high energy 
mechanism injuries which cannot be 
covered in an exhaustive list (for 
example, the variety of blunt instruments 
that could be used in a violent assault) 
which were considered to be important 
by the GDG. 
UPDATE 2007: 
The height threshold for a high-risk fall is 
sometimes defined as greater than three 
feet, and sometimes as greater than 1 
metre. For the sake of consistency, this 
guideline will use the term ‘1 metre’. The 
recent CHALICE53 rule recognises falls of 
greater then 3 metres were highly 
associated with the development of 
intracranial lesions. 
4.9 
Drug or alcohol intoxication 
Drug or alcohol intoxication can result in 
signs and symptoms which are risk 
factors for intracranial complications (for 
example, vomiting, headache, amnesia, 
impaired consciousness) but have also 
been identified as independent risk 
factors following head injury, making a
