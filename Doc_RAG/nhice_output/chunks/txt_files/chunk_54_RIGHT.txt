the need to request CT imaging of the 
head and/or imaging of the cervical 
spine. The guidance on patient 
selection and urgency for imaging 
(head and cervical spine) should form 
the basis for the final decision on 
imaging after discussion with the 
radiology department. See 
recommendations 3.5.3.1 to 3.5.4.2 
(imaging of the head) and 3.5.5.1 to 
3.5.7.2 (imaging of the cervical spine). 
3.5.1.8 
[Amended] Patients who, on initial 
assessment, are considered to be at 
low risk for clinically important brain 
injury and/or cervical spine injury 
should be re-examined within a 
further hour by an emergency 
department clinician. Part of this 
assessment should fully establish the 
need to request CT imaging of the 
head and/or imaging of the cervical 
spine. The guidance on patient 
selection and urgency for imaging 
(head and cervical spine) should again 
form the basis for the final decision on 
imaging after discussion with the 
radiology department. See 
recommendations 3.5.3.1 to 3.5.4.2 
(imaging of the head) and 3.5.5.1 to 
3.5.7.2 (imaging of the cervical spine). 
3.5.1.9 
 [NEW] Pain should be managed 
effectively because it can lead to a rise 
in intracranial pressure. Reassurance 
and splintage of limb fractures are 
helpful; catheterisation of a full 
bladder will reduce irritability. 
Significant pain should be treated with 
small doses of intravenous opioids 
titrated against clinical response and
