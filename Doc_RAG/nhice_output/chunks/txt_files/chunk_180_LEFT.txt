Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
Both models rely on evidence combined 
with expert opinion to estimate the time 
to intervention.  For the Staffordshire 
model, expert opinion is also used to 
estimate the survival rates.  For the 
London model, expert opinion is also 
used to estimate the target times.  Thus 
there must still be uncertainty around the 
results of both studies as they are not 
based on hard evidence.   
Both research teams recommend bypass 
if the specialist hospital is Â”20 minutes 
from the injury scene.  The Staffordshire 
model estimated substantial survival 
gains from bypass even if the specialist 
hospital is much further away (53 
minutes).  There are no obvious 
contradictions between the two models 
but the authors of the London report 
have been more cautious in 
recommending bypass over longer 
distances.
