Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
Glasgow Coma Scale and its derivative 
the Glasgow Coma Score (GCS). 
Recommended versions are shown in 
Appendix M and Appendix N. Good 
practice in the use of the Glasgow Coma 
Scale and Score should be adhered to 
at all times, following the principles 
below. 
3.2.1.1 
Monitoring and exchange of 
information about individual patients 
should be based on the three separate 
responses on the Glasgow Coma Score 
(for example, a patient scoring 13 
based on scores of 4 on eye-opening, 
4 on verbal response and 5 on motor 
response should be communicated as 
E4, V4, M5). (D) 
3.2.1.2 
If a total score is recorded or 
communicated, it should be based on 
a sum of 15, and to avoid confusion 
this denominator should be specified 
(for example, 13/15). (D) 
3.2.1.3 
The individual components of the GCS 
should be described in all 
communications and every note and 
should always accompany the total 
score. (D) 
3.2.1.4 
The paediatric version of the Glasgow 
Coma Score should include a ‘grimace’ 
alternative to the verbal score to 
facilitate scoring in pre-verbal or 
intubated patients.  (D) 
3.2.1.5 
Best practice in paediatric coma 
observation and recording as detailed 
by the National Paediatric 
Neuroscience Benchmarking Group 
should be followed at all times. (these 
principles are detailed in Appendix N).
