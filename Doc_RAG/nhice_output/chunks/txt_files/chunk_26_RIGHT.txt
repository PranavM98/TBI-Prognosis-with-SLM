Admission 
Acute head injury admissions account for 
320,900 bed days in hospitals in 
England (plus a further 19,000 in Wales 
by population extrapolation) 
representing 0.64% of all NHS bed 
days. 2,3This represents a significant 
resource burden on the NHS. However 
only 1-3% of admitted patients actually 
go on to develop life-threatening 
intracranial pathology, with the 
remainder going home within 48 hours, 
having had no intervention other than 
observation.7,8,20 
Also of concern is the quality of the 
observation that patients receive while in 
hospital. In a recent retrospective survey 
of 200,000 children in the North-East of 
England, only 14 children who presented 
with a minor head injury required 
neurosurgery. However, the recognition 
of secondary deterioration was delayed 
in all 14 patients, with documented 
routine neurological observations in only 
one child. Diagnosis of an intracranial 
haematoma was made between 6 hours 
and 14 days after the head injury, with 
a median delay of 18 hours.31 
This is not a problem unique to the UK. In 
the USA it has been found that only 
50% of patients admitted with a minor 
head injury had documentation of 
neurological observations and for the 
majority of these, the frequency of 
observations was not sufficient to detect 
early neurological deterioration.32 In the 
UK, patients with head injury have 
historically been observed on non-
