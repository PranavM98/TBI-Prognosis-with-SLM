- Copious bleeding into mouth (for 
example, from skull base fracture). 
- Seizures.  
[Amended] An intubated patient 
should be ventilated with muscle 
relaxation and appropriate shortacting sedation and analgesia. Aim for 
a PaO2 greater than 13 kPa, PaCO2 4.5 
to 5.0 kPa unless there is clinical or 
radiological evidence of raised 
intracranial pressure, in which case 
more aggressive hyperventilation is 
justified. If hyperventilation is used, 
the inspired oxygen concentration 
should be increased. The mean arterial 
pressure should be maintained at 80 
mmHg or more by infusion of fluid 
and vasopressors as indicated. In 
children, blood pressure should be 
maintained at a level appropriate for 
the childâ€™s age.  
Education, training and audit are 
crucial to improving standards of 
transfer; appropriate time and funding 
for these activities should be provided.  
Carers and relatives should have as 
much access to the patient as is 
practical during transfer and be fully 
informed on the reasons for transfer 
and the transfer process. 
These recommendations are based on 
level five evidence and are considered 
to be grade D recommendations.

Transfer of children 
The recommendations in section 7.8.6 
above were written for adults but the 
principles apply equally to children
