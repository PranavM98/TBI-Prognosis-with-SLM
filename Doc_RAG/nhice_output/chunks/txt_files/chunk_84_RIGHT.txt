Immediate management of patients with 
severe head injuries 
There are specific questions regarding 
the early management of patients with 
severe head injuries (that is, GCS less 
than or equal to 8). Exhaustive 
systematic reviews have examined 
evidence on the management of severe 
traumatic brain injury.64,65These reviews 
found evidence for only a small number 
of “standards” (that is, recommendations 
generally based on class one evidence 
or strong class two evidence of 
therapeutic effectiveness) and concluded 
that there was a paucity of well 
designed studies examining the efficacy 
of pre-hospital interventions in severe 
head injury. 
Given these findings, no changes to 
current practice were recommended in 
the pre-hospital management of patients 
who have sustained a severe head 
injury.

The benefits of direct transport from the 
scene to a specialist neurosciences centre 
compared to transport to the nearest 
district general hospital 
5.5.1 
Introduction and rationale for the 
clinical question 
This question has been included in this 
update because many healthcare 
professionals, especially ambulance 
staff, may be uncertain when deciding 
on the most appropriate destination for 
a patient with severe head injury. This is 
pertinent as the severity of head injury 
may not be known at the scene and the 
nearest neuroscience unit may be further
