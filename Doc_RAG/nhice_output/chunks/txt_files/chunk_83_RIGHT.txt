in intracranial pressure. Reassurance 
and splintage of limb fractures are 
helpful; catheterisation of a full 
bladder will reduce irritability. 
Analgesia as described in 6.13 should 
be given only under the direction of a 
doctor.

Glasgow Coma Score 
The Glasgow Coma Scale and its 
derivative the Glasgow Coma Score are 
widely used in the assessment and 
monitoring of patients who have 
sustained a head injury59,60. 
The assessment and classification of 
patients who have sustained a head 
injury should be guided primarily by the 
adult and paediatric versions of the 
Glasgow Coma Scale and its derivative 
the Glasgow Coma Score47,61,62. 
Recommended versions are shown in 
Appendix M and Appendix N. Good 
practice in the use of the Glasgow Coma 
Scale and Score should be adhered to 
at all times, following the principles 
below. 
- Monitoring and exchange of 
information about individual patients 
should be based on the three separate 
responses on the GCS (for example, a 
patient scoring 13 based on scores of 4 
on eye-opening, 4 on verbal response 
and 5 on motor response should be 
communicated as E4, V4, M5). 
- If a total score is recorded or 
communicated, it should be based on 
a sum of 15, and to avoid confusion 
this denominator should be specified 
(for example, 13/15).
