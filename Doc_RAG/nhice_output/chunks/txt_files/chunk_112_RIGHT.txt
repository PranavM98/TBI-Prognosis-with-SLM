patients had their fracture picked up by 
additional imaging. 
In the Canadian study, 68% of the 
sample underwent plain radiography. 
All participants were telephoned at 14 
days to assess for any missed injuries, as 
there was no other universal gold 
standard imaging applied, but 577 
participants originally entered into the 
study could not be traced by telephone 
and did not have a cervical spine 
radiograph and so were later excluded. 
This is clearly of methodological concern. 
The NEXUS study performed three-view 
imaging in 87% of all participants. They 
had a different follow up protocol in 
that they set up a surveillance protocol, 
looking for any missed fractures 
returning to any of the participating 
hospitals.  None was found. 
The two rules overall adopt very 
different strategies in the generation of 
their rules in that the NEXUS group has 
selected clinical correlates from the 
history and the examination without 
advising any specific tests in the 
examination, whereas the Canadian 
rules have been generated around an 
interim test of the ability to actively 
rotate the neck, thereby increasing the 
specificity markedly. With regard to the 
similarities of the rules, NEXUS 
categorises patients who are not alert as 
high risk, whereas the Canadian rules 
considers such patients to be at high risk 
on an a priori basis. Both identify 
absence of midline tenderness as a 
means of triaging to low risk. NEXUS 
immediately puts them at low risk 
whereas the Canadian rule marks them 
as low risk if they can also rotate the
