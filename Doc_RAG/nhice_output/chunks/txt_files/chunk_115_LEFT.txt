risk factors (that is, are aged greater 
than or equal to 65 years, or who have 
had a dangerous mechanism of injury) 
should have some neck pain or 
tenderness before receiving cervical 
spine imaging. 
UPDATE 2007: 
The GDG decided that no change should 
be made to the original recommendation 
that the Canadian Cervical Spine Rule 
(CCR) should be used for selecting 
patients with cervical spine damage for 
the most accurate imaging technique. 
The GDG agreed that in cases where 
there is a severe head injury to an adult, 
a CT cervical spine examination is 
required. Adults and children age 10 or 
over should have a CT cervical spine if 
they are having a CT of the head. CT of 
all cervical spines is not recommended 
as there is no evidence to support this 
practice.
