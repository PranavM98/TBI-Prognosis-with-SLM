10 Medical radiation
10.1 
Introduction 
The medical use of radiation for 
diagnosis and therapy is the largest 
source of radiation exposure to humans 
outside natural background radiation. 
The main diagnostic sources of radiation 
are X-ray examinations, particularly 
those involving CT.  Magnetic Resonance 
Imaging does not involve ionising 
radiation.Recent advances in CT 
technology, particularly the advent of 
multislice helical CT, have led to 
dramatic improvements in image quality 
and speed of acquisition. These have 
resulted in more clinical applications for 
CT imaging and an explosive growth in 
the number of CT examinations 
performed in countries that have access 
to this technology. The radiation doses 
received by the patient remain 
considerably larger for CT compared to 
conventional X-ray imaging, but dosesaving features introduced into the latest 
scanners and the adoption of more 
optimised scanning protocols have led to 
small reductions in patient dose for some 
CT examinations over the past few 
years. In 1998 CT examinations 
accounted for 4% of all X-ray imaging 
procedures in the UK and contributed
