Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
The Canadian cervical spine rule could 
save valuable health service resources 
but it is yet to be validated and if it was 
found to be less sensitive it might not be 
the most cost-effective strategy due to 
the morbidity and high costs associated 
with paralysis. This cost analysis was 
limited because of the use of overseas 
data and the simplified assumptions 
regarding dealing with inadequate Xrays. Furthermore the analysis did not 
include outcomes 3-8 from Table 11.4. 
11.4.3 
Update 2007 
Five new studies were found: a nonrandomised controlled trial117, two 
cohort studies118,193, a case series119 and 
a decision model120. One study193 was 
evaluating the role of MRI scanning in 
children, another study 117 was 
comparing helical CT scanning with Xray in children, and the rest were 
comparing CT scanning with X-ray in 
adults.   
A non-RCT 117 compared the costs of 
helical CT with those of X-ray in a 
population of 136 children who required 
cervical spine radiography in addition to 
cranial CT. The imaging costs including 
follow-up tests were £100 and £130 
respectively for the radiography and CT 
diagnostic strategies (significance not 
reported).   
A retrospective cohort study 118 based 
on an adult population of 573 trauma 
patients undergoing spinal imaging (the 
proportion with head injury was not 
reported) compared the costs of helical 
CT with X-ray. Unlike the non-RCT, this 
study found the cost of CT was no 
greater than X-ray (£36 vs £35) due to
