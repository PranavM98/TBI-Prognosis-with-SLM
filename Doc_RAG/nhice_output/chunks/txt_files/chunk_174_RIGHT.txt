The model estimates time to intervention 
using flow charts. Figure 1Error! 
Reference source not found. shows the 
flowchart for an isolated head injury 
patient with the average times based on 
current practice. Similar flowcharts were 
devised for the different types of 
trauma. The timings were based on 
ambulance service records and expert 
opinion.   
For each type of injury, a group of 
clinical experts decided on a target time 
for intervention.  For head injury, it was 
considered that it was crucial to carry 
out neurosurgery within 4 hours of the 
injury, based on some evidence186.  For 
each service configuration scenario, the 
primary outcomes were:  
x the median times to critical and 
definitive interventions. 
x the proportion of patients receiving 
critical and definitive interventions within 
the relevant time target.
