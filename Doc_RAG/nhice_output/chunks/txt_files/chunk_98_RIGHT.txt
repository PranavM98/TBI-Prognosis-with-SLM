the NEXUS II derivation study to 
determine if the prediction rule was 
effective on children. The prevalence of 
clinically important ICI was 8.3%. The 
sensitivity was 98.6% (95% CI, 94.999.8) and the specificity 15.1% (95% 
CI, 13.3-16.9). When the sub-group of 
children under 3 years old was 
examined the sensitivity was 100% 
(95% CI, 86.3-100). 
The second prospective cohort study 
(diagnostic study level I evidence) by 
Haydel et al86 comprised 175 children 
(5-17 years) with minor head injury from 
trauma centre in US. Minor head injury 
was defined as blunt head trauma with 
loss of consciousness and a normal GCS 
score, or modified coma scale for infants 
and children and normal brief 
neurological examination. The reference 
standard was a CT scan. The NOC 
prediction rule was applied to the 
population to determine children with 
intracranial injury. The prevalence was 
8%. The sensitivity was 100% (95% CI, 
73-100) and the specificity was 25.5% 
(95% CI, 19.1-33.0%). The CT ordering 
rate was reduced by 23.4% (95% CI, 
17.7-30.2).  
Palchak87 reported a prospective cohort 
study (diagnostic study level II evidence) 
of 2,043 children (under 18 years) 
presenting with blunt head trauma of all 
severities at a paediatric emergency 
department at a level 1 trauma centre. 
Significant predictors of traumatic brain 
injury were determined and the 
prediction rule was derived using 
recursive partitioning. The reference 
standard was CT scanning and clinical 
follow-up. The prediction rule had a
