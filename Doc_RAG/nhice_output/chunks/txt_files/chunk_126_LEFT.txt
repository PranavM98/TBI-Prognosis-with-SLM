Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
designed to track pre-hospital and inhospital severe TBI patient data, called 
TBI-trac. All patients passing through the 
trauma centres were included, and 
selection criteria were applied. 
Therefore, out of 1449, only 1123 
patients were included; the remainder 
were excluded on the basis of a welldefined criterion, which included the 
mechanism of injury, death, brain death, 
or otherwise not benefiting from the 
care on offer. The authors compared, 
using a logistic regression model, twoweek mortality outcomes between 
patients directly transferred to a trauma 
centre (n=864, 77.3%), and those who 
were transferred first to a non-trauma 
centre, and then on to a trauma 
centre(n=254, 22.7%). The model 
controlled for baseline characteristics 
and clinical data including hypotension 
status on day one, if the patient was less 
than or more than 60 years old, pupil 
status on day 1, and the initial GCS. 
Admission time and time by transport 
status were found to not affect the 
significance of the results. Patients were 
found to have a significantly lower 
chance of mortality with direct transfer 
with an odds ratio of 1.48 (CI 1.032.12) and p=0.04.

Economics Evidence from 2007 update 
There was no new economic evidence for 
this question found in the update. 
7.8.4 
Summary of evidence from 2007 
update 
Only one study134 provides some good 
evidence that all patients with severe 
head injuries (GCS 8 or less) would 
benefit from receiving treatment in a
