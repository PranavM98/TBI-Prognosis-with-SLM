Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
case mix issues, especially the older age 
profile of patients with head injury in 
England and Wales.41 A sub-group 
analysis performed by the authors of 
this paper found that since 1989 there 
has been no improvement in the age 
and severity adjusted odds of death for 
patients with severe head injury in 
England and Wales (Lecky F, personal 
communication). 
The supply of emergency neurosurgical 
beds in the UK is limited. A recent survey 
revealed only 43 neurosurgical intensive 
care beds available for an overall 
estimated population of 63.6 million.42 
This shortfall can lead to delays in 
patient transfer, and is symptomatic of 
larger resource and workload issues for 
neurosurgery in the UK.43 These larger 
resource problems have many 
implications for head injury care, 
including delays obtaining a 
neurosurgical opinion at night or at the 
weekend. 
Finally there is increasing awareness of 
a high level of disability following 
minor/mild head injury. The provision of 
diagnostic and treatment services could 
bring great benefits to patients who 
would otherwise spend prolonged 
periods off work or dependent on 
others. Unfortunately, neurorehabilitation 
services in England and Wales do not 
have the capacity to provide the volume 
of services currently required.
