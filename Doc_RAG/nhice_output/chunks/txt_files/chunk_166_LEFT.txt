Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults.

Cost-effectiveness model – imaging of the cervical spine 
We conducted our own tentative cost analysis comparing the NEXUS and the Canadian cervical 
spine rules. We estimated that the Canadian rule could save about £14 per patient (Table 
11.10).

The assumption that a CT scan will be performed after all inadequate X-rays may over-estimate 
the actual cost savings; if we omit them then the cost-savings are £4 per patient scanned. 
Sensitivity ranges are presented in Table 11.11.
