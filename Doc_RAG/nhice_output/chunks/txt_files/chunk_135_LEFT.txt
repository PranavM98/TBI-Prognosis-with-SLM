Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
non-randomised controlled trials, cohort 
studies, and case series.  
In total, 394 relevant studies were 
included and put through a rigorous 
coding procedure. The following pieces 
of information were coded for each 
study using the abstract: 
x Aim of the study – whether explicitly 
or implicitly about referral for 
rehabilitation, and also whether it aimed 
to compare, develop or validate a tool, 
or attempted to carry out a multivariate 
analysis and thus infer a referral tool. 
x Population – age group, injury 
severity. Other details were recorded 
under the variables section. Infants are 
children less than 1 year, adults are over 
18. Injury severity was defined using the 
GCS system or if the authors used the 
words ‘mild’, ‘moderate’, or ‘severe’ in 
the abstract.  
x Study design – type of study.  
x Variables considered – these were 
categorised into certain groups. Every 
piece of information explicitly collected 
about the patient was categorised and 
noted. Therefore variables included 
predictors, outcomes, demographics, 
classifying information and so on. 
Ninety two studies were identified as 
being explicitly about tools for referral. 
However, the remaining 302 studies 
were included as in a complete 
systematic review they would contain 
useful information; for example, the 
authors may have investigated variables 
which could be used to form a clinical
