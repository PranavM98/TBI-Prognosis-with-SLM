Good practice in emergency 
department assessment 
The main focus of emergency 
department assessment for patients 
who have sustained a head injury 
should be the risk of clinically 
important brain injuries and injuries to 
the cervical spine and the consequent 
need for imaging. Due attention 
should also be paid to co-existing 
injuries and to other concerns the 
clinician may have (for example, nonaccidental injury, possible nontraumatic aetiology such as seizure). 
Early imaging, rather than admission 
and observation for neurological 
deterioration, will reduce the time to 
detection of life-threatening 
complications and is associated with 
better outcomes.
