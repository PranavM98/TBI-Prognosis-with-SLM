Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
CI, 81.6 to 100%) sensitivity and the 
CCHR had a higher specificity of 37.5% 
(95% CI, 34.9% to 40.0%) compared to 
NOC 3.0% (95% CI, 1.2% to 4.8%). 
Neurocranial traumatic CT findings and 
important CT findings reported a higher 
sensitivity for the NOC rule. Outcomes 
were also reported on the entire 
population, which resulted in the authors 
adapting the rules to their study 
population. This study has 
methodological concerns as the rules 
tested were adapted to fit into their 
study population.  
The final study83 was a prospective 
cohort derivation study (diagnostic study 
level II evidence) for the NEXUS II rules 
by Mower et al which has not yet been 
validated in a separate sample. This 
study comprised 13,728 blunt trauma 
patients in 21 participating centres who 
had undergone a head CT scan. The 
prevalence of intracranial injury was 
6.7% (917 out of 13,728). The 
prediction rule had 8 criteria highly 
associated with intracranial injuries. The 
rule had a sensitivity of 98.3% (95% CI, 
97.2% to 99.0%) and specificity of 
13.7% (95% CI, 13.1% to 14.3%).  
UPDATE 2007: Child rules 
Four new studies in children53,85-87 were 
retrieved in this update.  
Oman at el85 studied a prospective 
cohort (diagnostic study level II 
evidence) of 1666 children (under 18 
years) with blunt head trauma. Patients 
underwent CT scanning from 21 
emergency departments in the NEXUS 
cohort. This study looked at children in
