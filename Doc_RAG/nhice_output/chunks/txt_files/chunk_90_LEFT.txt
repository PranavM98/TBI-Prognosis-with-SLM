Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
who have sustained a head injury 
should be the risk of clinically 
important brain injuries and injuries to 
the cervical spine and the consequent 
need for imaging. Due attention 
should also be paid to co-existing 
injuries and to other concerns the 
clinician may have (for example, nonaccidental injury, possible nontraumatic aetiology such as seizure). 
Early imaging, rather than admission 
and observation for neurological 
deterioration, will reduce the time to 
detection for life-threatening 
complications and is associated with 
better outcomes17,72. 
These recommendations are based on 
level five evidence and are considered 
to be grade D recommendations.

Investigation of clinically important brain 
injuries 
A systematic review of clinical decision 
rules for the selection of patients who 
have sustained a head injury for CT 
imaging of the head was carried out 
according to the methods outlined in 
Chapter Two. Six level one 
studies19,22,24,55,73,74 were identified. It 
was agreed that the review would focus 
on this evidence, but also give due 
cognisance to the findings of a level one 
systematic review examining the 
prognostic value of a diagnosis of ‘skull 
fracture’23 and a level two study that 
reported on the first part of a project 
likely to produce level one evidence.25 
The studies may be divided into 
contextual information and actual
