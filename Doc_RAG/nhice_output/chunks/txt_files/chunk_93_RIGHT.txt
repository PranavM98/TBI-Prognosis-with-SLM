to be not significant in favour of CT 
(95%CI: -6.1%-0.6%). The worst 
outcomes like mortality and severe loss 
of function were similar between the 
groups. None of the patients with normal 
findings on immediate CT had 
complications later.

Summary of evidence from 2007 
update 
The Af Geijerstam study78 showed that 
the use of CT in the management of 
patients with mild head injury leads to 
similar clinical outcomes compared with 
observation in hospital. 
The associated economic evaluation79 
showed that for these mild head injured 
patients CT scanning and then discharge 
after a negative scan was cost saving 
compared with admission with no 
adverse effect on health outcome.

6.5.1 
Introduction and rationale for the 
clinical question 
In order to improve the efficiency of the 
management of minor head injury, 
clinical prediction rules can be applied. 
A clinical prediction rule is derived from 
original research and is defined as a 
decision making tool that incorporates 3 
or more variables from the history, 
examination or simple tests25,80,81. This 
review was carried out to examine which
