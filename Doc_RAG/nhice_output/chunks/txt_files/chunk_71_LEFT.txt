Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
injuries or head injuries associated with 
multi trauma. Further specification about 
what level of consciousness would be 
suitable for primary transfer to a 
neurosciences unit would be required. 
Researchers should look at the impact of 
the duration of transport on study 
outcome. So for a journey time to the 
neurosciences unit of less than 20 
minutes, direct transport might improve 
outcomes, (as concluded by the London 
Severe Injury Working Group) but 
beyond this time, direct transport might 
worsen outcomes.   
In addition to measuring changes in 
morbidity and mortality, the costeffectiveness of direct transport should 
be modelled in terms of the cost per 
quality-adjusted life-year gained. A 
protype model was produced for the 
2007 update of this guideline (1.1.1). 
3.10.2 
Research is needed to establish the 
validity of previously derived clinical 
decision rules on the selection of head 
injured infants and children for CT 
scanning to exclude significant brain 
injury.  
3.10.2.1 Why this research is important 
The 2002 NICE guidelines recommended 
that children be selected for CT scanning 
on the basis of the Canadian Head CT 
rule, a clinical decision rule derived and 
validated in adults. This was due to the 
absence of such a rule derived in 
children. However since this date the 
CHALICE rule has been published which 
presents a clinical decision rule derived 
in a large group of children and infants
