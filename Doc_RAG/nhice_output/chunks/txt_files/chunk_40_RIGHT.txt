Guideline update methodology 
The guideline update was commissioned 
by NICE and developed in accordance 
with the guideline development process 
outlined in 'The guidelines manual' 
updated in April 200645 and 200744.

Developing the clinical questions 
Clinical questions were developed to 
guide the literature searching process 
and to facilitate the development of 
recommendations by the GDG. The 
clinical questions were initially drafted 
by the review team and were refined 
and validated by the GDG. The 
questions were based on the scope 
(Appendix A). 
2.12 
Clinical literature search 
The aim of the literature search was to 
identify relevant evidence within the 
published literature, in order to answer 
the clinical questions identified. Searches 
of clinical databases were performed 
using generic and specific filters, 
relevant medical subject heading terms 
and free-text terms. Non-English studies 
and abstracts were not included. Each 
database was searched up to 8 January 
2007. Papers identified after this date 
were not routinely considered. Search 
strategies can be found in Appendix D. 
The following databases were included 
in the literature search to identify 
relevant journal articles: 
x Medline (Dialog Datastar) 19512006 
x Embase (Dialog Datastar) 1974-2006
