Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults.

Results of the cost-effectiveness analysis 
According to Model A there are large 
QALY gains and large cost savings 
associated with direct transport to the 
NSH – direct transport is dominant 
(Table 11.22). With Model B – the 
conservative model - the QALYs gained 
are smaller and costs are not decreased 
overall (Table 11.23 and Table 11.24). 
However, even with this conservative 
model, direct transport is cost-effective 
(below £20,000 per QALY gained). 
We chose the group of patients who 
were 40 years old at the time of injury 
to represent the results (Table 11.22, 
Table 11.23 and Table 11.24). In the 
tables we report the results for the 
groups of patients of 20 and 60 of age 
as well. In these cases, direct transport 
was the dominant strategy in Model A 
and the incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio was still below the threshold of £ 
20,000 per QALY in Model B. 
After running the Model B 5,000 times, 
the probability that directly transporting 
all the patients to the NSU is costeffective (i.e. probability that the costeffectiveness ratio is below £20,000 per 
QALY gained) is 73% when the NSU 
near the incident scene (within 20 
minutes).  In the cases of a patient aged 
20 or 60, the probability falls to 66%.  
For Model B, we performed a sensitivity 
analysis on the length of stay in the ICU: 
assuming that the most costly level 3 of 
care applies to all the outcome grades, 
the analysis shows that the direct 
transport would still be cost-effective as 
long as the increased length of stay
