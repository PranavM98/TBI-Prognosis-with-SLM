Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
Guidance on the process of transferring 
patients of all ages who may have 
sustained non-accidental injury, including 
liaison with appropriate community care 
and legal organisations are contained in 
a recent Department of Health 
manual.138 
8.7 
Discharge and Glasgow Coma Scale status 
No patients presenting with head 
injury should be discharged until they 
have achieved GCS equal to 15, or 
normal consciousness in infants and 
young children as assessed by the 
paediatric version of the Glasgow 
Coma Scale.  
This recommendation is based on level 
five evidence and is considered to be a 
grade D recommendation. 
8.8 
Discharge advice 
All patients with any degree of head 
injury who are deemed safe for 
appropriate discharge from an 
emergency department or the 
observation ward should receive 
verbal advice and a written head 
injury advice card. The details of the 
card should be discussed with the 
patients and their carers. If necessary 
(for example, patients with literacy 
problems, visual impairment or 
speaking languages without a written 
format), other formats (for example, 
tapes) should be used to communicate 
this information.  Communication in 
languages other than English should 
also be facilitated.  
The risk factors outlined in the card 
should be the same as those used in 
the initial community setting to advise
