UK Guidelines 
The first UK-wide guidelines on 
identifying patients who were at high 
risk of intracranial complications 
following a head injury were drawn up 
by a Working Party of Neurosurgeons in 
1984.10 They were used in the UK for 
over 15 years and relied on various 
clinical factors, particularly the level of 
consciousness, to place patients with a 
head injury into different risk categories. 
The main investigation incorporated into 
these guidelines was skull radiography, 
reflecting the importance of skull 
fracture as a risk factor for intracranial 
complications. Modifications to this 
guideline have since been published by 
the Society of British Neurological 
Surgeons in 1998, the Royal College of 
Surgeons of England in 1999 and by the 
Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines 
Network in 2000.11-13The assessment 
and imaging of patients who have 
sustained a head injury is also 
addressed by guidelines from the Royal 
College of Radiologists.14 
The recent recommendations of the 
Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines 
Network centre around the identification 
of patients with a high (for example, 
over 10%) risk of intracranial 
complications using the GCS, the 
presence of a skull fracture and various 
other clinical variables. These high-risk 
patients are recommended for computed 
tomography (CT) scanning. Admission for 
observation was considered a tool for 
patients with a 'medium-risk' of 
intracranial complications13 but the value 
of this in terms of sensitivity and
