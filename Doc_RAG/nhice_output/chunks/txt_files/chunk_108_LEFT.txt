Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
6.7.5 
Rationale behind recommendation 
There is no evidence at present to 
suggest that cervical spine CT scanning is 
required for everyone regardless of 
head injury severity; the economic 
evidence suggests that it would not be 
cost-effective for head injury patients 
with a low risk of spinal damage. The 
GDG previously recommended that Xrays should be the initial imaging 
modality of choice supplemented with CT 
when appropriate.   
The new evidence108-110 indicates that in 
severely head injured patients, CT is the 
best initial diagnostic tool for assessment 
of the cervical spine.The GDG suggested 
a change in wording of the 
recommendation to add that patients 
with head injury (GCS Â” 13) and 
intubated patients should have CT scans 
of the cervical spine rather than plain 
radiographs.  
If CT detects more unstable fractures 
then potentially it will lead to health 
gain and cost savings by averting 
paralysis. The cost-effectiveness 
evidence117-121 suggests that CT scanning 
of the cervical spine is cost-effective in 
higher risk groups but not in all head 
injured patients. These studies were 
conducted from a US perspective and 
therefore are not directly applicable to 
the UK NHS. Logically, as long as CT is 
picking up more unstable fractures, 
cervical spine CT will be cost-effective 
for those NHS patients at the very 
highest risk; the threshold at which it 
becomes not cost-effective is, however, 
difficult to determine.
