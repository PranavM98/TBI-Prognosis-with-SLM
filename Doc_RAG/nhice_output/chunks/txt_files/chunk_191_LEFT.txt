Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
small compared with the additional 
rehabilitation and care costs incurred by 
survivors.  
We calculated the increased transport 
cost associated with false positives, as 
they will be transported to a more 
distant hospital. The cost was obtained 
from the unit cost of an ambulance per 
minute, Â£6.50 204, multiplied by the 
distance of the accident scene to the 
hospital, which was 20 minutes (near) or 
53 minutes (far) in the simulation study68.

Methods: Rehabilitation and care costs 
We derived the cost of rehabilitation 
from two UK studies: one, Wood 
1999147, applicable to the severely 
disable patients and the other one, 
Nyein 1999205, applicable to the 
moderately disabled patients (Table 
11.20). The length of rehabilitation for 
the severely disabled group was 14 
months, while it was 75 days for the 
moderately disabled group. We 
assumed patients who had a good 
recovery to undergo the same intensity 
of rehabilitation as the moderately 
disabled group, given the fact that the 
good outcome was assessed six months 
post-injury. Patients in a vegetative state 
were assumed not to receive any 
specific rehabilitative therapy. If any 
rehabilitation service was provided to 
them, its cost was assumed to be 
incorporated in to the cost of long term 
care.   
The same two UK studies were used to 
calculate the annual care costs 
(Tab.11.20); in the case of severely
