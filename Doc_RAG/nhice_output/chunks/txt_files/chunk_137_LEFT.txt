Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
The derivation cohort study to create this 
clinical decision rule could potentially be 
conducted in conjunction with the 
validation of the CHALICE rule, with 
follow up of patients involved in this 
study at 6mths-1yr. This would ensure 
optimal value for money for funders and 
ensure good results in a large cohort of 
patients. Separate studies could also be 
performed in adults but the initial study 
may in fact be more urgent in the 
childhood population.  
Identification of patients likely to suffer 
from long term sequelae will allow 
targeted research regarding 
responsiveness to, or effectiveness of 
focused rehabilitation programmes. 
Preventative action could potentially be 
taken, thus reducing the strain on 
resources further down the care 
pathway. Furthermore, patient outcomes 
could potentially be improved by early 
identification and treatment (both 
curative and preventive) of problems. 
However, further research is required 
before we can be certain that a robust 
framework exists with which to cope with 
individuals identified by the clinical 
prediction rule proposed above.

Outpatient appointments 
Every patient who has undergone 
imaging of their head and/or been 
admitted to hospital (that is, those 
initially deemed to be at high risk for 
clinically important brain injury) 
should be routinely referred to their 
General Practitioner for follow-up 
within a week after discharge.  
When a person who has undergone 
imaging of the head and/or been
