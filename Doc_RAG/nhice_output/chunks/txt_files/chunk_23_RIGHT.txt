were male admissions and 30% were 
children under 15 years of age.2,3 
Extrapolating on the basis of relative 
population size gives an estimate of a 
further 6,700 head injury admissions in 
Wales. There are no reliable up to date 
figures for the total denominator of 
attenders with a head injury at 
emergency departments.  A figure of 
one million emergency department 
attenders for the United Kingdom as a 
whole is often quoted but this is based 
on figures from the late 1970s.4  It is 
estimated that head injury admissions 
represent around 20% of all head injury 
attenders,5 which would imply around 
600,000 patients per annum attending 
emergency departments in England and 
Wales with a head injury. The true 
emergency department attendance rate 
may be closer to 700,000 patients 
however, as it is likely that the 
proportion of patients with head injury 
admitted to hospital has fallen below 
20% in recent years. The poor quality of 
information regarding head injury 
attenders should improve as the use of a 
common emergency department dataset 
increases. 
The number of patients who undergo 
neurosurgery each year following a 
head injury is also unclear. A figure of 
around 4,000 patients per year for the
