changes in health service resource use 
for the particular patients affected.  
However in both cases the net change in 
health service costs could go up or down. 
For example, if an improvement in 
neurosurgical outcome leads to more 
patients surviving but those that survive 
require long term care for chronic brain 
injury then costs would increase. 
Alternatively if both mortality and 
disability were reduced then long term 
costs are likely to be reduced.  
However, whichever direction the change 
is in, the average change in costs per 
patient scanned is likely to be small 
given the low likelihood of a change in 
health outcome. 
11.3.5 Patient costs (7&8, see Table 11.2) 
The costs (time, lost income, medication 
purchased, etc) to patients and their 
families associated with changes in 
health outcome could be considerable.  
As with health service costs we could not 
be certain what the net effect would be 
for the family. Again when averaged 
across all patients these cost changes 
could be quite small because the 
incidence of these changes in outcomes 
will be small. 
There may be substantial costs 
associated with the decision to admit but 
these are likely to differ according to 
the situation of the family. For example, 
if a parent is admitted then there might 
be a need for child-minders but on the 
other hand the act of regular 
observation at home is costly in itself 
and families might find it easier if this 
burden were undertaken by the hospital.
