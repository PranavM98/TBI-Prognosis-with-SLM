community and university hospitals who 
underwent cervical imaging following 
blunt trauma. Only adults with a GCS 
score equal to 15 were included. 
The Canadian cervical spine rule 
excluded patients who were not fully 
alert at the time of assessment (that is, 
GCS equal to 15) on the assumption that 
these patients would automatically 
receive cervical spine imaging. The 
NEXUS rule included all levels of 
alertness. The NEXUS paper reports an 
overall cervical fracture rate of 2.4% 
and a clinically significant fracture rate 
of 1.7%, while the Canadian paper 
reports an overall fracture rate of 2.0% 
with a clinically significant cervical spine 
fracture rate of 1.7%. The NEXUS rule 
had no age exclusion whereas the 
Canadian rules were derived and 
validated only on patients aged over 16 
years. 
The Canadian cervical spine rule gives a 
sensitivity of 100% (95% CI: 98-100) 
and NEXUS gives a sensitivity of 99.6% 
(95% CI: 98.6-100). The NEXUS rule is 
not 100% sensitive but of the two 
clinically significant missed fractures one 
had an extension-teardrop fracture and 
self discharged. He was well at six 
months. One had a fracture of the right 
lamina of the sixth cervical vertebra 
requiring open fixation, but may have 
been incorrectly classified as low risk by 
the institution as he had loss of 
consciousness and neurological signs. Of 
interest, Stiell et al tested the NEXUS 
rule on the Canadian cervical spine 
cohort and found that the sensitivity of 
the NEXUS rule was only 93%. They also 
criticise the NEXUS rule for the poor
