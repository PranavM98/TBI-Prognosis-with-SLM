decision rules. Four studies provide level 
one evidence on the following important 
contextual issues. First, skull X-ray is of 
limited value in assisting the diagnosis of 
ICH as the sensitivity of a positive 
finding is only 38%.23 While it is true 
that a finding of skull fracture on 
radiography significantly elevates the 
risk of ICH one cannot rule out ICH on 
the basis of a negative radiograph 
(sensitivity was 0.38, see section 1.5). 
Second, patients with a negative CT scan 
and no other body system injuries or 
persistent neurological findings can be 
safely discharged22. The negative 
predictive power quoted in this study 
was 99.7%. 
Third, a strategy of either 100% CT 
imaging or high quality in-patient 
observation for patients who have 
sustained a minor/mild head injury will 
be 100% sensitive.73,74The task is 
therefore to derive a more sophisticated 
clinical decision rule for patient selection 
that will improve specificity without 
impairing sensitivity.

What is the best initial diagnostic 
technique to determine which patients 
have sustained damage to the brain and 
require further assessment of the head? 
6.3.1 
Introduction and rationale for the 
clinical question 
In the 2003 guideline the GDG 
recommended CT imaging for the head 
as the primary investigation of choice 
for the detection of acute clinically 
important brain injuries (see 6.3.6). In 
this update a review was carried out to 
ascertain whether CT is still in 2007 the
