6.10.1 
Recommendations for research 
The GDG identified the following 
priority areas for research. 
6.10.1.1 
Research Question 
Research is needed to establish the 
validity of previously derived clinical 
decision rules on the selection of head 
injured infants and children for CT 
scanning to exclude significant brain 
injury.  
6.10.1.2 Why this research is important 
The 2002 NICE guidelines recommended 
that children be selected for CT scanning 
on the basis of the Canadian Head CT 
rule, a clinical decision rule derived and 
validated in adults. This was due to the 
absence of such a rule derived in 
children. However since this date the 
CHALICE rule has been published which 
presents a clinical decision rule derived 
in a large group of children and infants 
from the UK with good sensitivity and 
specificity.  
However, clinical decision rules often 
provide an overestimate of their 
performance when applied to new 
populations. We now recommend the 
usage of the CHALICE rule for children 
suffering a head injury in the UK, with 
the caveat that a validation of the rule 
in a new population of head injured UK 
patients be urgently undertaken to 
ensure its reliability and reproducibility.    
Such a study is now essential and 
performing a validation of the CHALICE 
study in a novel UK population may 
easily be performed in a 1-2 year 
timeframe with acceptable costs, and
