categories of patient requiring cervical 
spine imaging. Cervical spine imaging if 
indicated should be carried out urgently 
as these patients will often need CT of 
the head once the cervical spine has 
been cleared. 
[Amended] Imaging of the cervical 
spine should be performed within 1 
hour of a request having been 
received by the radiology department 
or when the patient is sufficiently 
stable. Where a request for urgent CT 
imaging of the head (that is, within 1

cervical spine imaging should be 
carried out simultaneously. 
This recommendation is based on level 
five evidence and is considered to be a 
grade D recommendation.

Involving neurosurgical care 
The care of all patients with new, 
surgically significant abnormalities on 
imaging should be discussed with a 
neurosurgeon. The definition of

neurosurgical referral letter is shown 
in Appendix L .13. 
This recommendation is based on level 
five evidence and is considered to be a 
grade D recommendation. 
Examples of abnormalities not surgically 
significant have been produced by a 
survey of neuroradiologists and 
emergency physicians in Canada.25
