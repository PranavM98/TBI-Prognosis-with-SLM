researchers looking to improve on their 
findings. 
Of the remaining papers: length of posttraumatic amnesia, period of loss of 
consciousness, abnormal initial GCS, 
gender, age, positive radiological 
findings and various neuropsychometric 
tests have been advocated as being 
associated with an increased risk of PCS, 
but there is no data as to how these 
variables might combine as a decision 
rule for the safe exclusion of low risk 
patients from follow-up. 
In the original guideline, there was 
insufficient evidence for the 
recommendation of any decision rules 
that can safely exclude a patient from 
follow up although several high-risk 
variables have been reported. 
UPDATE 2007: 
In this update, no clinical evidence 
review was carried out due to a vast 
amount of evidence in this area and the 
limited framework of this update. 
Therefore a thorough evidence map was 
conducted to aid future research in this 
area. 
8.10.2 Clinical evidence 
A search was developed to identify 
papers which attempted to develop, 
compare or validate a clinical prediction 
rule which would identify those patients, 
using variables collected during the 
acute phase of care, who would suffer 
long term sequelae and who would 
therefore benefit from rehabilitation. 
We considered systematic reviews, RCTs,
