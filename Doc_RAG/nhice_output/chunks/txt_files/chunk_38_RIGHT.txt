A brief description of the rule proposed 
was extracted. Many papers do not 
provide explicit description of the 
diagnostic strategies, inclusion criteria, or 
post-diagnosis management strategies 
(for example, eligibility for early 
discharge).  The participant descriptions 
extracted were GCS levels, age, 
prevalence of important outcomes 
(especially intracranial haemorrhage) 
and the main inclusion and exclusion 
criteria. If a non-consecutive sample was 
described (for example, selection 
criteria was CT imaging where 100% CT 
imaging was not the rule being tested) 
this was noted. The outcomes extracted 
included the need for neurosurgery, ICH, 
intracranial injury and clinically 
important brain injury and CT ordering 
rate. Data on specificity and sensitivity 
were recorded where possible; 95% 
confidence intervals were also recorded 
or calculated if possible.

Systematic review of indications for 
imaging of the cervical spine 
The systematic review aimed to identify 
clinical decision rules which could be 
used to select patients who are at high 
risk of clinically important cervical spine 
fracture, and who therefore should have 
three-view plain radiography followed 
by other imaging if these prove 
inadequate. 
This search produced 863 abstracts in 
MEDLINE and 268 in EMBASE (after 
duplicates had been removed). An initial 
screen for relevance was carried out by 
one systematic reviewer, which reduced 
the number of abstracts to 142 papers 
in MEDLINE and 10 papers in EMBASE. 
These abstracts were then independently
