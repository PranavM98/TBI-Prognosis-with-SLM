with a neurosurgeon include: 
- persisting coma (GCS less than or 
equal to 8) after initial resuscitation. 
- unexplained confusion which

grade D recommendation.

patient. The exact nature and timing of 
the interventions is beyond the scope of 
the guidelines.

settings 
The risk of a further injury to patients 
during transfer to tertiary care is well 
established.128 In the previous guideline 
transfer of the patient between a 
general hospital and a neurosciences 
unit were advised to follow the 
principles set out by the
