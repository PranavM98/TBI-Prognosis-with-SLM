Britain and Ireland and the Association 
of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and 
Ireland.129 The recommendations are 
listed below see section 7.9.7 with slight

targets recommended for intubated 
patients are based on recent literature 
in this area.130-132 Since the original 
guideline there has been an update of 
the guidance from the Association of 
Anaesthetists133 which has been
