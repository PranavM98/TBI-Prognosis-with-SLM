Organisation of transfer of patients 
between referring hospital and 
neuroscience unit 
[Amended] Local guidelines on the 
transfer of patients with head injuries 
should be drawn up between the 
referring hospital trusts, the 
neuroscience unit and the local 
ambulance service, and should 
recognise that: 
- transfer would benefit all patients 
with serious head injuries (GCS Â” 8), 
irrespective of the need for 
neurosurgery 
- if transfer of those who do not 
require neurosurgery is not possible, 
ongoing liaison with the neuroscience 
unit over clinical management is 
essential.  
3.1.5 
Advice about long-term problems and 
support services  
[Amended] All patients and their 
carers should be made aware of the 
possibility of long-term symptoms and 
disabilities following head injury and 
should be made aware of the 
existence of services that they could 
contact should they experience longterm problems. Details of support 
services should be included on patient 
discharge advice cards.
