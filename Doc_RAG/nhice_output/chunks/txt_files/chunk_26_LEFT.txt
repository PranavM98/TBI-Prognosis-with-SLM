Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
times higher than before testing) but one 
cannot rule out an intracranial 
haemorrhage in patients for whom a 
skull X-ray does not show a skull 
fracture. 
One reason for the low sensitivity of 
skull X-ray in predicting an intracranial 
haemorrhage is the reliability of 
radiographic interpretation. It has been 
consistently shown that clinically 
competent emergency department 
clinicians will miss between 13% and 
23% of all skull fractures that are 
detected when radiographs are 
subsequently reviewed by a 
radiologist.20,27,28 
As CT scanning has both sensitivities and 
specificities approaching 100% for 
detecting and locating a surgically 
significant focal intracranial lesion, it has 
been established as the definitive 
diagnostic investigation in patients who 
have sustained a head injury. The 
relatively low ordering rate for CT in the 
UK has historically been a function of 
availability. However, there has been a 
substantial investment in CT scanners in 
England and Wales over the last 
decade, increasing the capacity of 
modern scanners within the NHS 
considerably. In addition, CT technology 
has advanced considerably in recent 
years (for example, multisection helical 
CT), reducing the duration of an 
examination, improving the imaging 
output and reducing radiation exposure. 
The new scanners have greatly reduced 
the need for general anaesthesia and 
reduced the sedation rate in infants and 
patients rendered combative by their 
injuries.29,30Nevertheless, anaesthesia
