Prioritisation of recommendations for 
implementation 
To assist users of the guideline in 
deciding the order in which to implement 
the recommendations, the GDG 
identified up to ten key priorities for 
implementation. The decision was made 
after discussion and voting by the GDG. 
They selected recommendations that 
would: 
x Have a high impact on patient 
outcomes, including mortality and 
morbidity 
x Have a high impact on reducing 
variation 
x Lead to a more efficient use of NHS 
resources 
x Mean patients reach critical points in 
the care pathways more quickly

Validation of the guideline 
Registered stakeholders were given the 
opportunity to comment on the draft 
guideline, which was posted on the NICE 
website. A Guideline Review Panel also 
reviewed the guideline and checked that 
stakeholders' comments had been 
addressed.
