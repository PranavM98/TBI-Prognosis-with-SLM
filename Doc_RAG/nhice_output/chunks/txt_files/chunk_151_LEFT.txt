Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
5. Estimate the ratio of net health gain to 
net resource cost (for example, the cost 
per QALY gained) and compare this 
with the ratios estimated for other 
commonly used health programmes to 
assess its relative efficiency. The 
estimation of net health gain and net 
cost requires some kind of model (such 
as a decision analysis) to combine 
probability and outcome information. 
6. Consider the robustness of the costeffectiveness estimate in terms of 
statistical precision and generalisability 
to other settings. 
Ideally one would repeat each of these 
steps for each procedure considered 
within the guideline (and within each 
procedure, for each relevant patient 
subgroup). This would allow us to see for 
which group of patients the procedure is 
good value for money. In practice we 
are limited by the availability of data.

Methods 
The guideline development group 
identified two main areas where the 
potential impact of alternative strategies 
could be substantial. 
x Diagnosis of life-threatening important 
brain injuries in patients with minor head 
injury 
x Identifying cervical spine damage in 
patients with head injury. 
A third area, identification of patients 
most likely to experience long term 
sequelae, was also considered for 
economic evaluation. However, the lack 
of satisfactory clinical decision rules in 
this area means that this area remains
