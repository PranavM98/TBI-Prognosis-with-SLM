observation. Arrangements should be 
in place for urgent transfer to a centre 
with CT scanning available should 
there be a clinical deterioration that 
indicates immediate CT scanning is 
necessary.

What are the effects on patient outcomes 
of providing an immediate CT versus 
observation? 
6.4.1 
Introduction and rationale for the 
clinical sub question 
A question that arises from identifying 
CT as the best initial imaging technique 
to determine which patients have 
sustained damage to the head and 
require care is whether providing an 
immediate CT yields better patient 
outcomes compared with observation. A 
review of the clinical evidence was 
deemed necessary as a sub-question as 
a part of the previous clinical question 
(see 6.3). 
6.4.2 
Clinical evidence  
One study (level 1++ evidence) was 
identified78 for this review. This recent 
large, randomised controlled trial78 
investigated CT compared with 
admission to hospital for observation. 
This study included hospital patients 
aged Â•6 years of age with mild head 
injury within the past 24hrs who 
attended emergency departments. The 
main findings from this trial were that at 
3 months, 21.4% (275/1316) of 
patients in the CT group had not 
recovered completely compared with 
24.2% (300/1286) admitted for 
observation. The difference was found
