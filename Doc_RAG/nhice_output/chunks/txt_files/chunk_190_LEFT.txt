Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
In the sensitivity analysis on the 
assessment at the scene, we assumed 
that the false positives, if they survive 
the longer transport, would have had the 
same expected QALYs as the good 
recovery (GR) patient.    
Calculating QALYs gained 
 
For Model A, the QALYs gained are 
calculated as follows: 
QALYs gained= Q1-Q0 
Qi = ( PiGR x LEGR x UGR) + (PiD x LED x 
UD)  
where  
Qi =the expected QALYs per patient 
(i=1: with bypass, i=0: without bypass) 
PiGR, PiD, = proportion of patients in each 
of the GOS states at 6 months by 
strategy (where D is both mild disability 
and severe disability combined). 
LEGR, LED, = the discounted life 
expectancy of patients by GOS states 
at 6 months  
UGR, UD, = the utility score for each GOS 
state. 
 
 
For Model B, the QALYs gained are 
calculated as follows: 
QALYs gained=Qi-Q0= ESi x ( ( PGR x 
LEGR x UGR) + ( PMD x LEMD x UMD) + ( PSD 
x LESD x USD) + ( PVS x LEvs x Uvs) ) 
where  
Qi =the expected QALYs per patient 
associated with bypass strategy i,  
Q0 = the expected QALYs per patient 
associated with no bypass,  
ESi = extra survivors=the proportion of 
patients surviving under strategy i that 
would not have survived under the no 
bypass strategy 
PGR, PMD, PSD, PVS, = the proportion of 
extra survivors in each of the GOS 
states at 6 months 
LEGR, LEMD, LESD, LEVS, = the discounted 
life expectancy of patients by GOS 
states at 6 months 
UGR, UMD, USD, UVS, = the utility score for 
each GOS state.
