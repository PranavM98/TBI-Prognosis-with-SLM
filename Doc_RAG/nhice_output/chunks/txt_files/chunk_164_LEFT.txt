Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
One of the centres in the Hassan study16 
had modified the protocol so that 
elderly patients with a GCS of 15 seen 
out of hours could be admitted instead 
of getting urgent CT. The reasoning 
involves a combination of factors: a) the 
cost of out-of-hours radiology was 
relatively high, b) the elderly represent 
quite a large group and there are often 
difficulties in trying to discharge them 
over night. Hence, the modification is 
lower cost since out-of-hours radiology is 
avoided and most would needed 
admission anyway.  We don’t have 
evidence of effectiveness for this specific 
patient group but the randomised 
evidence for the general population 
showed no difference in outcomes 
between observation and CT scan79. The 
GDG agreed that this was an 
acceptable deviation from the head rule 
and the guideline recommendations 
were modified accordingly. 
A decision analysis76compared the 
Canadian head CT rule with several 
strategies including ‘CT all’, ‘admit all’, 
‘discharge all’ and ‘X-ray all’ in a US 
context. Quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) and costs were estimated for 
both prompt and delayed surgery by 
comparing the mortality and recovery 
rates in different case series. The 
Canadian rule dominated the other 
strategies, that is to say it gave the 
highest number of QALYs and the lowest 
cost. However, the study did not 
evaluate the earlier UK guidelines 
based on skull X-ray and admission. The 
CT all strategy was just as clinically 
effective but more costly. The results 
were sensitive to the probability that
