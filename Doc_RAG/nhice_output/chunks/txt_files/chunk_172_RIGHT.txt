for cervical spine imaging in the UK. If 
this is not the case then a move to the 
Canadian cervical spine rule might not 
lead to cost savings. 
It is clear that the long term morbidity 
associated with injury to the head and 
cervical spine and the lack of evidence 
concerning suitable rehabilitation are a 
major problem. Not only does it reduce 
the quality of life for these individuals 
and their carers but also it places a 
substantial burden on society in general 
through time off work and social security 
payments.195 Hence the development of 
effective rehabilitation programmes 
should be placed high up the research 
agenda. 
The other elements of the guideline are 
probably more conservative and 
therefore the overall impact on health 
service resources is probably small 
although it remains uncertain. 
11.5.1 Conclusions from the 2007 update 
A randomised controlled trial has 
confirmed that to discharge patients with 
mild head injury (GCS15) after a 
negative CT scan, as recommended in 
this guideline, is both safe and cost 
saving.   
The impact of the Canadian CT rule as 
advocated in the original edition of this 
guideline has varied considerably but 
reassuringly in some centres it has 
reduced costs. A published model that 
took into account long term treatment 
costs and health consequences indicated 
that the Canadian head CT rule is more 
cost-effective than a number of 
alternative strategies based on CT, X-
