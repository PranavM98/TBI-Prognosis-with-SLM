Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults.

Methods 
2.1 
Guideline development group 
A Guideline Development Group (GDG) 
representing all relevant professional 
and patient parties was formed in 
December 2001, under the 
Chairmanship of Professor David Yates 
from the Trauma Audit and Research 
Network.   
2.2 
Working principles 
It was decided by the GDG to focus the 
full systematic reviewing methods used in 
these guidelines on the selection of which 
patients who have sustained a head 
injury should be referred for imaging of 
the head and cervical spine, given that 
these issues are at the heart of acute 
management of head injuries. It was 
agreed that brief literature reviews and 
formal consensus methods would be used 
to deal with the remaining topics. 
For the purposes of the guidelines it was 
agreed that ‘infants’ are aged under 1 
year, ‘children’ are 1-15 year olds and 
‘adults’ are aged 16 years or more. In 
certain circumstances, the age group 
‘infants and young children’ (that is, 
aged under 5 years) is used. Cut-off 
points of 10 years and 12 years are 
also used where appropriate. ‘Head 
injury’ for the purposes of the guidelines 
is defined as any trauma to the head, 
other than superficial injuries to the face. 
It was also agreed that the primary 
patient outcome of concern throughout
