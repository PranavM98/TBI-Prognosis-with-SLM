Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
Model B, a conservative model, 
calculates only the health gain 
attributable to those patients who 
survive with direct transport but would 
not survive with a secondary transfer 
strategy. The number of these extra 
survivors is estimated using the results of 
a decision model that was explicitly 
answering our question â€“ Stevenson et al 
200168 (see 11.6.3). Model B does not 
take into account health gain for 
patients who survive under both 
strategies but have an improved health 
status with the direct transport strategy.
