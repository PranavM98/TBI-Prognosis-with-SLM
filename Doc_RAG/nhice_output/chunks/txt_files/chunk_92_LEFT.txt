Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
a suitable substitute for CT. However, it 
was necessary to acknowledge that 
plain x-rays are useful adjuvant to CT in 
managing children with suspected nonaccidental injury and therefore a new 
recommendation was developed (see 
update 2007 recommendation).  
6.3.6 
Recommendation 
The current primary investigation of 
choice for the detection of acute 
clinically important brain injuries is CT 
imaging of the head. 
This recommendation is based on level 
one evidence and is considered to be a 
grade A recommendation. 
For safety, logistic and resource 
reasons, magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) scanning is not currently 
indicated as the primary investigation 
for clinically important brain injury in 
patients who have sustained a head 
injury, although it is recognised that 
additional information of importance 
to the patientâ€™s prognosis can 
sometimes be detected using MRI.77  
MRI is contraindicated in both head 
and cervical spine investigations 
unless there is absolute certainty that 
the patient does not harbour an 
incompatible device, implant or 
foreign body.  
There should be appropriate 
equipment for maintaining and 
monitoring the patient within the MRI 
environment and all staff involved 
should be aware of the dangers and 
necessary precautions for working 
near an MRI scanner.  MRI safety,
