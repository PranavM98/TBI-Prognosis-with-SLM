Clinical evidence  from update 2007 
In the update two diagnostic 
studies123,124 were identified (level I 
evidence) that examined patients with 
head injury and suspected cervical spine 
injury.  
One prospective cohort study123 
comprised 7438 consecutive adult 
patients in nine Canadian emergency 
departments with acute trauma to the 
head or neck who were in a stable and 
alert (GCS 15) condition. These patients 
had neck pain or no neck pain but 
visible injury above the clavicle and 
were non-ambulatory and had a 
dangerous mechanism of injury. This 
study sought to validate the CCR and 
also compares the outcomes to the 
NEXUS low risk criteria (NLR). Patients 
received an X-ray when ordered by the 
treating physician or were followed up 
with a structured telephone interview 
with a nurse to ensure no injuries were 
missed.  
162 patients (2%) had cervical spine 
injury. The CCR had a higher sensitivity 
than NLC, which was 99.4% (95% CI, 
96-100) compared to 90.7% (95% CI, 
85-94) respectively. CCR had a higher 
specificity (45.1% [95% CI, 44-46]) 
compared to NLC (36.8% [95% CI, 3638]). CCR had a lower ordering rate 
than NLC (55.9% vs 66.6%). The CCR 
missed one injury compared to NLC 
which only identified 147 of the 162 
cervical spine injuries. There was an
