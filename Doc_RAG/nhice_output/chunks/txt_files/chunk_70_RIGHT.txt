followed as they pass through the care 
system with mortality and morbidity 
outcomes collected. These should be 
compared to allow, using sub-group 
analysis, the identification of patients for 
whom direct transfer is most beneficial. 
3.10.1.1 Why this research is important 
Limited evidence in this area has shown 
that patients do better in terms of 
outcome if they are transported directly 
to a neurosciences centre when 
compared to those who are taken to the 
nearest district general hospital. This 
evidence however does not appear to 
have influenced current practice. For 
people working in the prehospital arena, 
it is important to define which patients 
who have sustained a head injury would 
do better by being transported directly 
to a neurosciences centre. 
Currently patients are either always 
transported to the nearest district 
general hospital as is the case in most 
land vehicle deployment or in some 
organisations especially those involving 
helicopter emergency medical services 
the decision is left to the judgement of 
the clinicians at the scene. Those patients 
transported to the nearest district 
general hospital may suffer a significant 
delay in receiving definitive treatment 
for their head injury. Information from 
such research can help to define which 
patients should be transported direct to 
a neurosciences centre bypassing the 
nearest hospital.  
Guidance will be required to define the 
patient population for example, 
researchers may focus on isolated
