an issue only on the research agenda at 
this time. 
UPDATE 2007: 
For both of the identified areas, a 
review of the literature was conducted 
followed by simple economic modelling 
of the cost-effectiveness in England and 
Wales of different strategies.  The costs 
in these models were updated to 20056 prices for the 2007 update and the 
evidence summaries were modified 
accordingly. 
A full literature review for the 
rehabilitation question was not 
conducted during the 2007 update 
either. The list of the relevant papers 
retrieved can be found in 8.10.3 
A fourth area was added during the 
2007 update – the issue of which 
patients can bypass the nearest 
emergency department and go straight 
to a neurosciences centre from the scene 
of injury – see 11.6. 
11.2.1 Literature review 
Using the same search strategy as for 
the main systematic reviews but with an 
additional filter to locate costing 
information, a search (Appendix 1) was 
performed of:
