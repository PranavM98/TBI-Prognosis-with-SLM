Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
paediatric hospitals or trauma centres. 
The cohort compared 3 sub groups 
defined by the site of intubation; in the 
field, in the trauma centre (n=1874) or 
in a non-trauma centre (n=1647). Taking 
the data from the latter two branches, 
risk stratification was performed in 
patients whose degree of head injury 
was measured using the New Injury 
Severity Score (NISS), and the Relative 
Head Injury Severity Scale (RHISS). The 
main outcomes were unadjusted 
mortality rates and functional outcomes. 
Patients who were assessed using the 
different scales had no significant 
differences in outcome or the place of 
intubation. Mortality (observed vs 
expected) rate in group 1 was 16.5% 
and in group 2 was 13.3%. 
Stratification of injury by NISS or 
degree of head injury showed that 
higher mortality rates were not only 
observed in the severely head injured 
patients who were intubated in a non 
trauma but also the mild and moderate 
head injured patients. Some doubt 
remains over the definition of head 
injured patients as it is unclear if these 
were isolated injury or part of a multiple 
trauma. This affects the conclusions one 
can draw from this study.

With one study67 it is difficult to draw 
rational conclusions as to the benefits of 
direct transport of patients from the 
scene to either a neurosciences unit or a 
DGH as there is doubt over the
