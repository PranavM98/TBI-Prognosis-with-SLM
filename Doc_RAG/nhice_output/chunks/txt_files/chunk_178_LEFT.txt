Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
Model Results 
 
11.13 shows the median time to 
critical/definitive intervention by type of 
injury and by bypass strategy used.  On 
the left side of the table the results are 
based on current timings.  On the right 
hand side the results are based on 
improved timings.  In the case of the 
isolated head injury patient the median 
time to neurosurgery is 4.8 hours 
currently but would fall to 3.4 hours 
when bypassing patients who are less 
than 20 minutes from a specialist centre.  
Table 11.14 shows the proportion of 
patients that receive interventions within 
the target time.  In the case of the 
isolated head injury patient the number 
receiving neurosurgery within 4 hours 
would increase from 23% with no 
bypass to 74% with bypassing patients 
who are less than 20 minutes from a 
specialist centre.  However, on the 
negative side with this bypass strategy 
only 84% (compared with 91%) would 
receive critical intervention within 60 
minutes.  The group that is made worse 
off by bypass is those patients with 
isolated orthopaedic injury: only 25% 
would receive their definitive 
intervention within their 2 hour target 
(compared with 30% without bypass). 
For the injuries that can be treated in 
every hospital the most rapid movement 
to Definitive Intervention was achieved 
by the models without bypass, and with 
improvement in hospital times. 
For injuries requiring specialist 
management the best models for 
providing early Definitive Intervention 
included 20 minutes bypass,
