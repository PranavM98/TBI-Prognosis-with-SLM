are transferred to a specialist 
neurosciences centre than if they 
remained at the initial DGH.  
An emergency department is described 
as a local, regional district general 
hospital with no neurosciences unit or a 
non specialist centre whereas a 
neurosciences unit is described as a 
specialist centre or a unit that has 
neurosurgical and neurointensive care 
facilities. 
The main outcome measures for including 
studies in this review were mortality, 
neurological outcome, disability and 
hospital duration and at least one of 
these outcomes were reported in the 
studies. Studies were excluded where; 
x data on head injury patients were not 
provided,  
x the patient group was less than 50% 
head injured patients, 
x  intervention was pre hospital care 
rather than transfer and  
x the outcomes reported only duration 
of transfer and no other outcomes.

Clinical evidence  
One study134 was identified that looked 
at interhospital transfer (secondary 
transfer from one hospital to another). 
Three additional studies66,135,136 looked 
at direct transport from the injury scene 
to a DGH or transfer to a neurosciences 
unit from a DGH.  
The first study134 a prospective 
observational study (level 2+ evidence) 
included patients of any age who were 
injured by blunt trauma between 1996-
