Neurosciences Hospital (NSH). Severe 
head injury patients initially admitted to 
the DGH will be subsequently referred 
to the NSH. Patients that survive will 
require rehabilitation and frequently 
some kind of long term care. The number 
of survivors is different in the different 
strategies.  
To assess the cost-effectiveness of direct 
transport we need to assess not just 
changes to ambulance and emergency 
department costs associated with each 
strategy but also any changes in 
rehabilitation and long term care costs 
arising from the different strategies. 
These have to be balanced against the 
health gain. 
We could not find evidence of 
effectiveness that perfectly suits this 
question.  We therefore constructed two 
similar models based on different 
empirical studies:  
Model A: We based this model on the 
only study in the clinical literature review 
that reported both mortality and health 
status (Glasgow Outcome Scale, GOS) 
in head injury patientsâ€“ Poon et al 
1991135. This study compared a cohort 
of patients that had been directly 
transported to NSH to another cohort 
that were transferred from DGH. This 
study allows us to estimate both the 
QALYs gained and the cost savings 
attributable to improved care status in 
patients being directly transported. 
However, there was concern that this 
study was biased, since case-mix was 
not properly controlled for. For this 
reason we developed a more 
conservative model.
