GDG felt that a rigorous systematic 
review should be carried out to facilitate 
the development of the clinical 
prediction rule. The GDG therefore 
decided to propose a research 
recommendation on this topic. 
8.10.5 
Recommendations for research 
The GDG identified the following 
priority area for research. 
8.10.5.1 Research Question 
Research is needed to summarise and 
identify the optimal predictor variables 
for long term sequelae following mild 
traumatic brain injury. A systematic 
review of the literature could be used to 
derive a clinical decision rule to identify, 
at the time of injury, relevant patients. 
This would in turn lay the foundation for 
a derivation cohort study. 
8.10.5.2 Why this research is important 
We performed a review of the 
literature in this area, repeated in this 
update process. While 394 studies were 
identified that attempted to use a wide 
range of variables and tests to predict a 
range of longer term outcome measures, 
no robust clinical decision tools has 
successfully been derived and validated 
to identify patients at the time of injury 
who could be considered for follow-up 
due to a higher risk of long term 
sequelae. A systematic review of the 
literature would summarise and identify 
the optimal predictor variables for such 
a clinical decision rule and also identify 
the optimal outcome variables, thus 
laying the foundation for a derivation 
cohort study.
