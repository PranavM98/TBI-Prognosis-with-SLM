ACCGR, ACCD = annual care cost by 
GOS state at 6 months 
TC = cost of transport in secondary 
referral 
 
 
 
For Model B the incremental cost is 
calculated as follows: 
Incremental cost = Cost i - Cost 0  
= ESi x ((PGR x (RHGR + (LEGR x ACCGR))) 
+ (PMD x (RHMD + (LEMD x ACCMD))) 
+( PSD x (RHSD + (LESD x ACCSD))) + (PVS 
x (RHVS + (LEVS x ACCVS)))) 
 â€“ (TC x PDT)  
where 
Costi = the expected cost per patient 
associated with bypass strategy i 
Cost0 = the expected cost per patient 
associated with secondary referral 
ESi = the proportion of patients surviving 
under strategy i that would not have 
survived under the no bypass strategy 
PGR, PMD, PSD, PVS, = the proportion of 
extra survivors in each of the GOS 
states at 6 months 
RHGD, RHMD, RHSD, RHVS = the cost of 
rehabilitation by GOS states at 6 
months 
LEGR, LEMD, LESD, LEVS, = the discounted 
life expectancy of patients by GOS 
states at 6 months 
ACCGR, ACCMD, ACCSD, ACCVS = annual 
care cost by GOS states at 6 months 
TC = cost of transport in secondary 
referral 
PDT = proportion of patients directly 
transported to the NSU 
 
11.6.4.6 Probabilistic sensitivity analysis 
A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was 
performed to assess the robustness of 
the model results to plausible variations 
in the model parameters.  
This analysis was applied exclusively to 
the strategy of transporting all patients 
to the NSU (strategy 2) compared no 
bypass in the conservative model B.  
Probability distributions were assigned 
to each model parameter, where there 
was some measure of parameter 
variability (11.21).  We then reestimated the main results 5000 times,
