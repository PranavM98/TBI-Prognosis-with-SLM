Age 
An exact age threshold for identifying 
patients at high risk of intracranial 
complications following a head injury 
has not been identified, but it is clear 
that increasing age is associated with an 
increased risk and a poorer prognosis.50 
Commonly used thresholds are 60 
years19,51 and 65 years25,50. To avoid 
confusion, the GDG chose to adopt a 
standard age threshold throughout these 
guidelines of greater than or equal to 
65 years. An odds ratio of 4.1 (95% CI: 
2.8-6.1) for clinically important brain 
injury has been quoted with this 
threshold, providing the patient has 
experienced loss of consciousness or 
amnesia.25 
There is evidence that the prevalence of 
intracranial complications in children and 
infants is much lower than in adults. 
However, this should be weighed against 
the fact that an unknown, but significant, 
proportion of head injuries in children 
are non-accidental. These injuries may 
result in a different pattern of morbidity 
to that seen in adults, and obviously 
require investigation regardless of 
cause.

Mechanism of injury 
High energy injury mechanisms have an 
intuitive appeal in determining the risk 
of intracranial complications but there 
are difficulties with providing an exact 
definition of ‘high energy’. Terms such as 
‘assault’ or ‘road traffic accident’ cover 
a great heterogeneity of circumstance. A 
recent level two study has proposed the
