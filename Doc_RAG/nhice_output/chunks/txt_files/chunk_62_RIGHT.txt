3.6.1.5 
The transfer team should be provided 
with a means of communication with 
their base hospital and the 
neurosurgical unit during the transfer. 
A portable phone may be suitable 
providing it is not used in close 
proximity (that is, within 1 metre) of 
medical equipment prone to electrical 
interference (for example, infusion 
pumps). (D) 
3.6.1.6 
[Amended] Although it is understood 
that transfer is often urgent, initial 
resuscitation and stabilisation of the 
patient should be completed and 
comprehensive monitoring established 
before transfer to avoid complications 
during the journey. A patient who is 
persistently hypotensive, despite 
resuscitation, should not be 
transported until the cause of the 
hypotension has been identified and 
the patient stabilised. (D) 
3.6.1.7 
All patients with a GCS less than or 
equal to 8 requiring transfer to a 
neurosurgical unit should be intubated 
and ventilated as should any patients 
with the indications detailed in 
recommendation 3.6.1.8. (D) 
3.6.1.8 
[Amended] Intubation and ventilation 
should be used immediately in the 
following circumstances: 
- Coma – not obeying commands, not 
speaking, not eye opening (that is, 
GCS  8). 
- Loss of protective laryngeal reflexes. 
- Ventilatory insufficiency as judged 
by blood gases: hypoxaemia (PaO2< 
13 kPa on oxygen) or hypercarbia 
(PaCO2 > 6 kPa).
