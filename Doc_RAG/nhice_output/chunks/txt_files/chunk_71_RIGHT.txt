from the UK with good sensitivity and 
specificity.  
However, clinical decision rules often 
provide an overestimate of their 
performance when applied to new 
populations. We now recommend the 
usage of the CHALICE rule for children 
suffering a head injury in the UK, with 
the caveat that a validation of the rule 
in a new population of head injured UK 
patients be urgently undertaken to 
ensure its reliability and reproducibility.    
Such a study is now essential and 
performing a validation of the CHALICE 
study in a novel UK population may 
easily be performed in a 1-2 year 
timeframe with acceptable costs, and 
considerable benefits in terms of 
assuring clinicians as to the safety of this 
novel rule.

Research is needed to develop 
consensus on criteria for lesions not 
currently considered to be surgically 
significant following imaging of a 
patient with head injury. 
Although most neurosurgeons agree 
about which extradural and subdural 
haematomas should be removed, there is 
controversy about whether or not to 
remove traumatic intracerebral 
haemorrhage (TICH) and cerebral 
contusions (CC). A prospective 
randomised controlled trial (PRCT) 
should be set up to discover if early 
surgery improves the outcome in these 
lesions compared to initial conservative 
treatment.
