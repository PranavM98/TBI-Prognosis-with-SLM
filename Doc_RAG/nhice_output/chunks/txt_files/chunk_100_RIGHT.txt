Summary of evidence from 2007 
update 
Adult Rule  
Three new studies81,83,84 were identified 
for this review which compared different 
decision rules in adults. One study81 
showed that for patients with minor head 
injury and GCS score of 15, the 
Canadian CT head rule had a higher 
specificity than NOC for clinical 
important outcomes. This study also 
showed that the Canadian CT head rule 
and NOC have equivalent high 
sensitivities for detecting the need for 
neurosurgical intervention and clinically 
important brain injury. The second 
study84 showed that for patients with 
minor head injury and a GCS score of 
13 to 15, the Canadian CT head rule 
has a lower sensitivity than the NOC for 
neurocranial traumatic or clinically 
important CT findings. The final study83 
included the NEXUS II rule which had a 
sensitivity of 98.3% and specificity of 
13.7%. 
When we updated the unit costs in the 
guidelineâ€™s cost analysis, the results were 
even more favourable towards the 
Canadian head CT rule, since radiology 
costs had fallen. Two studies16,88 of the 
impact of our recommendation for head 
imaging showed opposite results; there 
is still great uncertainty about the rates 
of imaging and admission nationally and 
therefore the overall economic impact of 
the guideline is unclear. A published 
economic evaluation76 using cohort study 
evidence suggested that the Canadian 
head CT rule is more cost-effective in a 
US context than a number of alternative 
strategies based on CT, X-ray or
