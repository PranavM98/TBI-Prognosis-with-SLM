Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
We estimated the health loss associated 
with false positives. In fact, for these 
patients the longer the journey from the 
accident scene to the hospital, the higher 
is the risk of death from hypotension. In 
the case of a distant NSH (53 minutes, 
as reported in Stevensonâ€™s model), the 
mortality increases by 0.05%, while it 
increases by 0.03% if the NSH is near 
(20 minutes). These figures derived from 
the calculation of the probability of 
death based on clinical estimates (see 
11.6.4.7).

Methods: Estimating QALYs 
For each health state we estimated 
QALYs (Quality-Adjusted Life Years) by 
multiplying the discounted life 
expectancy by the utility score 
associated with each state. The 
expected QALYs for each strategy are 
then estimated by summing up the 
QALYs for each state weighted by the 
proportion of patients in that state. 
In order to calculate the QALYs we 
combined data on life expectancy with 
data on quality of life. 
Life expectancy  
The life expectancy of patients in a 
vegetative state (VS) was assumed to be 
10 years 198,199. In the case of a 60 
year old patient in a VS, the life 
expectancy would be shorter and was 
assumed to be the same as for a patient 
in the severe disability state (see below).  
To calculate the life expectancy for 
health states other than VS, we applied 
the standardised mortality rate (SMR), 
reported for 2,320 traumatic brain
