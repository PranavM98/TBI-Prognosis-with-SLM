Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
For simplicity, neither model considers 
the change in health status during the 
patientâ€™s lifetime - they assume that the 
GOS score (assessed six months after 
the head injury) remains constant. If 
instead patients continue to improve 
after 6 months then our conservative 
model is underestimating the health gain 
and cost-effectiveness associated with 
direct transport. Likewise, our assumption 
that mortality is increased compared 
with the general population for survivors 
over their entire lifetime is a 
conservative one.  
We have probably underestimated the 
cost savings attributable to direct 
transport because we included only 
hospital personnel (one anaesthetist and 
a nurse), omitting for the costs of drugs, 
equipment and ambulance.  However, 
we have also omitted additional acute 
costs associated with direct transport in 
the treatment of complications such as 
hypoxia and hypotension, which are less 
likely if the patient has been stabilised 
earlier. This would require additional 
treatments such as volume replacement, 
blood transfusion, and in some extreme 
cases they would require surgery or 
ventilatory support for weeks.  
A strategy of direct transport from the 
injury scene to an NSH will inevitably 
mean that the unit sees more patients 
than previously, even though many 
patients currently being taken to the 
nearest emergency department are 
subsequently transferred to the NSH. 
From the viewpoint of the NSH there will 
be a substantial cost impact in particular 
in terms of ITU beds.
