Investigation of cervical spine injuries 
Patients who have sustained head injury 
may have co-incidental cervical spine 
injury. These patients require clinical and 
radiographic clearance of the cervical 
spine before removal of an 
immobilisation device. The major 
consequence of a missed bony or 
ligamentous injury is damage to the 
cervical cord. 
6.6.1 
Imaging options 
There are four options for imaging of 
the cervical spine. It is recognised that 
technological advances in imaging 
modalities may make the following 
discussion obsolete in the future. 
x Plain films: 
o cross table lateral 
o 3 film series (with swimmer’s view for 
cervico-dorsal junction if required) 
o 5 film series including ‘trauma 
obliques’. 
x Lateral flexion/extension series – 
immediate and/or delayed. 
x CT 
 (localised or whole cervical 
spine including cervico-dorsal junction). 
x Magnetic Resonance Imaging.

When adequate visualisation of the 
entire cervical spine is achieved a 
negative predictive value for a  three-
