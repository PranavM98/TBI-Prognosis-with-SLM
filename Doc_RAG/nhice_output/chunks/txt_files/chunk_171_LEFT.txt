Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
The Canadian head CT rule, adopted by 
the consensus of the Guideline 
Development Group is expected to 
reduce costs. There are also likely to be 
improvements in quality of care. In the 
short term this will mean fewer patients 
being diagnosed on ‘deterioration’, 
patients getting reassurance sooner 
rather than later and hopefully 
improvements in long term outcomes 
(although this is not based on high 
quality evidence). If patient outcomes 
are improved then this in turn might lead 
to additional cost-savings. It was the 
decision of the Guideline Development 
Group that the potential benefits of 
adopting this rule are likely to outweigh 
the potential costs. 
The NEXUS cervical spine rule and the 
Royal College of Radiologists guidelines 
appear to be almost identical. Given 
this, on the basis of a simple cost model, 
the adoption of the Canadian cervical 
spine rule could save valuable health 
service resources. This rule is yet to be 
validated, however, and if it was found 
to be less sensitive it might not be the 
most cost-effective strategy due to the 
morbidity and high costs associated with 
paralysis. On the other hand, the thyroid 
is known to be susceptible to radiation 
damage and strategies that reduce the 
need for radiological examination of the 
neck may reduce subsequent morbidity 
and health service cost. 
Our simple analyses estimated an 
additional scanning cost of £17 per 
head trauma patient associated with 
adopting the Canadian head CT and a 
cost saving of £14 associated with 
adopting the Canadian cervical spine
