point rule is therefore the focus of this 
review. However, it is recognised that 
the five point rule has some utility in 
determining the urgency with which CT 
imaging should be performed. 
Both papers present high quality 
evidence, but strictly the New Orleans 
criteria represents level one evidence as 
it has used separate samples for the 
derivation and validation phases. The 
Canadian rules represent level two 
evidence as they have not yet been 
validated in a separate sample (this 
study is ongoing and will report in 
2003). Both sets of authors caution 
against adoption of their rules, the 
Canadians because of the need for 
validation, and the New Orleans group 
because their rules were developed in 
one centre (the Canadian rules were 
developed in a multi-centre study). 
The Canadian sample25 for a derivation 
sample, was much larger with 3,121 
patients than the New Orleans sample19 
with 520 patients in the derivation 
phase and 909 patients in the validation 
phase. This led to statistical power 
problems with certain key variables (for 
example, coagulopathy) as not enough 
patients with these risk factors 
experienced a negative outcome. It 
should be noted that the Canadian study 
considered a much broader range of 
possible predictive variables, and has 
outlined in great detail the steps taken 
to ensure the validity and reliability of 
the data. Both studies used recursive 
partitioning as the multivariate technique 
used to derive the rules.
