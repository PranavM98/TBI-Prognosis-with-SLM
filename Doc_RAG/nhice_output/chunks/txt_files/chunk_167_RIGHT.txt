the staff time involved with CT being 
substantially less.    
In a case series study 119, 407 adult 
patients in a trauma centre underwent 
both X-ray and helical CT (again the 
proportion with head injury was not 
reported). The reference standard was 
represented by two radiologists 
independently reviewing both the HCT 
and plain X-ray results together with 
hospital case notes. The sensitivity 
yielded by X-ray was 45% while the 
sensitivity yielded by the helical CT 
intervention was 98%. The helical CT 
strategy was more costly than a 
strategy of helical CT after inadequate 
X-ray. From their figures, we calculate 
that this strategy costs an extra £7,300 
per fracture detected.  Using the model 
by Blackmore and colleagues121, as 
follows, we can see that this is highly 
cost-effective.  The model estimated that 
5% of fractures would lead to paralysis 
and that paralysis is associated with 16 
QALYs lost.  Hence £7,300 per fracture 
detected would translate to only £9,125 
per QALY gained and that is without 
taking in to account the considerable 
cost savings from averting paralysis. 
The decision analysis of helical CT vs Xray of the cervical spine in patients 
undergoing cranial CT for head injury 
by Grogan et al120 was based on an 
earlier model by Blackmore and 
colleagues121 looking at conventional CT 
vs X-ray. It considered only patients at 
medium and high risk: 
x Focal neuro-deficit or severe head 
injury or high energy impact, or
