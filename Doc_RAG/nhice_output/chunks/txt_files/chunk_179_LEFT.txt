neurosciences.  
x The trade-off between the need for 
immediate access to critical interventions 
(e.g. intubation) and the need for faster 
access to definitive interventions (e.g. 
surgery) was made on the basis of 
expert judgement rather than health 
outcomes. 
11.6.3 
Staffordshire model 
The link between time and health 
outcomes missed by the London model 
was captured to some extent in the 
Staffordshire model68.  
It evaluated the impact of 10 different 
transport strategies on survival of 
patients with serious or worse HI (AIS 
more than 2). In the model, survival was 
determined by a number of variables 
including: a) head AIS score, b) nonhead AIS score, c) time to surgery, d) 
grade of staff during transfer, e) 
incidence of hypoxia and hypotension, 
g) distance from hospitals. Some of these 
variables are patient-specific (a,b,g), 
some are service-specific (d) and some 
are determined by the transport 
strategy (c,e). The data used in the 
model came from a variety of sources 
including a large trauma database, the 
published literature and expert opinion.  
Monte Carlo simulation (that is 
repeatedly generating new results by 
simultaneously drawing at random from 
the distribution of each model 
parameter) was used to simulate 10,000 
head injury patients and their outcomes 
under each strategy. 
Table 11.15 shows the results for each 
strategy. All direct transport strategies
