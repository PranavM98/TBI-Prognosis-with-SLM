Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
Table 2: Levels of evidence for studies of the accuracy of diagnostic tests. Adapted from ‘The 
Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine Levels of Evidence’ (2001) and the Centre for 
Reviews and Dissemination ‘Report Number 4’ (2001).  
Levels of 
evidence  
Type of evidence  
Ia  
Systematic review (with homogeneity)
b 
Ib  
Level-1 studies
b 
II  
Level-2 studies
c  
Systematic reviews of level-2 studies  
III  
Level-3 studies
d 
Systematic reviews of level-3 studies  
IV  
Consensus, expert committee reports or opinions and/or clinical 
experience without explicit critical appraisal; or based on 
physiology, bench research or ‘first principles’  
a Homogeneity means there are no or minor variations in the directions and 
degrees of results between individual studies that are included in the systematic 
review.  
b Level-1 studies are studies:  
• that use a blind comparison of the test with a validated reference standard 
(gold standard)  
 
• in a sample of patients that reflects the population to whom the test would 
apply.  
 
c Level-2 studies are studies that have only one of the following:  
• narrow population (the sample does not reflect the population to whom the test 
would apply)  
• a poor reference standard (defined as that where the ‘test’ is included in the 
‘reference’, or where the ‘testing’ affects the ‘reference’)  
• a comparison between the test and reference standard that is not blind  
• case–control design.  
d Level-3 studies are studies that have at least two or three of the features listed 
for level-2 studies.
