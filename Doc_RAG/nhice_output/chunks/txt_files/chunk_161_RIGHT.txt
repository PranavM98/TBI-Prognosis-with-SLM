GOS) but costs were £133 less per 
patient in the CT arm. 
A retrospective case series of 40 
patients189 was used to evaluate the 
addition of an MRI to CT scanning in 
patients with traumatic brain injury. The 
number of lesions diagnosed by CT but 
not by MRI was 9 out of 40, while the 
lesions detected by MRI but not by CT 
were 24 out of 40. The addition of MRI 
cost more than £1,500 in additional 
charges per extra lesion diagnosed. 
However the identification of the 
additional lesions did not lead to a 
change in the treatment path and 
therefore the addition of MRI to CT was 
neither effective nor cost-effective. 
However, the cohort was small for 
estimating the effectiveness with any 
precision. 
A UK cohort study16 evaluated the 
consequences of implementing the NICE 
guideline. The X-ray and admissionbased practice was replaced with the 
Canadian CT head rule. Cases of head 
injury were followed up in a regional 
neurosciences hospital and in a district 
general hospital for one month, six 
months before and for one month after 
the guideline implementation. In the case 
of the neurosciences hospital the cost per 
patient was reduced by £34 and it was 
reduced by £3 per patient at the 
general hospital. In contrast in a similar 
cohort study88 of 992 patients, costs 
were found to increase by £77 per 
patient. Table 1 shows the resource use 
observed in both studies compared with 
the predictions in the original edition of 
this guideline. The evidence from the 
cohorts suggests that compared with our
