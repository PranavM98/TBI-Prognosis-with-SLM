Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
current modulation according to the 
thickness and density of the part of the 
patient being scanned, is also helping to 
reduce doses in the latest CT scanners.

Patient doses from head CT 
Specific dosimetry techniques and dose 
quantities have been developed for 
measuring patient radiation exposure. 
To relate the exposures to the risk of 
radiation-induced cancer (or deleterious 
hereditary effects), an estimate of the 
absorbed dose to a number of 
radiosensitive organs or tissues in the 
body is required.  
The absorbed dose to an organ or tissue 
dose, usually expressed in milligray 
(mGy), reflects the energy deposited by 
X-rays per gram of irradiated body 
tissue, averaged over the particular 
organ or tissue. 
The effective dose, usually expressed in 
millisieverts (mSv), is a calculated 
weighted sum of organ doses that takes 
into account organ differences in radiosensitivity and is a useful comparative 
index related to the total radiationinduced cancer risks from varying 
radiological procedures. 
The latest UK CT patient dose survey162 
shows the typical effective dose from a 
routine head CT examination on adults 
to be 1.5 mSv. This remains much the 
same for examinations on 10 year old 
and 5 year old children but rises to 
about 2.5 mSv for examinations on 
babies (0-1 years old). In comparison to 
conventional X-ray examinations of the 
skull with a typical effective dose of 
0.06 mSv166, CT head examinations
