Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
ray or admission. However, none of the 
evidence has taken into account the 
impact of the increased radiation 
exposure. 
Updating the costs to 2005-6 prices 
makes the Canadian CT head rule even 
more cost-effective, since the cost of 
imaging has fallen. 
A modification of the rule so that elderly 
patients with a GCS of 15 seen out of 
hours could be admitted instead of 
getting urgent CT is a safe strategy and 
could be cost saving for services where 
out of hours radiography costs are 
prohibitively high.   
The new studies add to existing 
evidence, in suggesting that CT scanning 
of the cervical spine is cost-effective in 
higher risk groups who are already 
undergoing head CT. However, none of 
these studies have taken into account the 
costs and health consequences 
associated with the increased radiation 
exposure â€“ it is possible that CT is no 
longer cost-effective when these are 
taken into account. It is difficult to model 
the impact of radiation exposure on 
cost-effectiveness since there are a 
large number of uncertainties: a) the 
amount of radiation received at 
different parts of the body, b) the 
relationship between exposure and 
cancer, c) the types of cancer caused, d) 
the pattern of resource use in the 
diagnosis and treatment of the cancer, 
and e) the timing of cancer, treatment 
and death. Another limitation with 
regard to cervical spine imaging is that 
all the studies were conducted in the 
USA; the observed healthcare costs and
