Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
The rules have the following similarities. 
Both suggest that patients with GCS less 
than 15 on presentation at emergency 
departments should have immediate CT 
imaging. The only caveat to this is that 
the Canadian rules specify GCS less 
than 15 two hours after injury. However, 
it should be born in mind that 93% of 
adults and 96% of children report to 
emergency departments with GCS equal 
to 15,15 implying that CT imaging for 
those with GCS less than 15 will not 
greatly impact on resources. The area of 
controversy is generally accepted to 
relate to patients with GCS equal to 15. 
Neither rule suggests a role for skull Xray or admission for observation without 
CT imaging. Both rules agree that 
vomiting should be included as an 
indication for imaging, although the 
Canadian rule specifies more than one 
episode. Both rules agree that skull 
fracture (linear, basal, depressed, open, 
depressed and penetrating) should be 
an indication for CT imaging but these 
are defined and dealt with in different 
ways. In the New Orleans rules this is 
included as part of a category named 
‘physical evidence of trauma above the 
clavicles’ which also includes contusions, 
abrasions and lacerations. Presumably 
these would include facial surface 
wounds and not only wounds to the skull. 
The Canadian rules seem to have 
considered obvious penetrating skull 
injury and/or obvious depressed skull 
fracture as a priori indications for 
imaging and have also included any sign 
of basal skull fracture, and any 
‘suspicion’ of open or depressed skull 
fracture as part of their rules.
