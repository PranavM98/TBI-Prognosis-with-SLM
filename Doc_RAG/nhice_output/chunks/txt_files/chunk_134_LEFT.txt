Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
8.10 
The best tool for identifying the patients 
who should be referred to rehabilitation 
services following the initial management 
of a head injury 
8.10.1 Introduction and rationale for the 
clinical question 
It is well known that some patients 
labelled as having had a minor head 
injury may experience long term 
disability following discharge from 
hospital. Symptoms such as headache, 
dizziness, memory deficits, slowness of 
thought, poor concentration, 
communication problems, inability to 
work and problems with self-care have 
been described. These patients are 
categorised by the International 
Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) as 
having post-concussional syndrome 
(PCS). 
Five papers were classed as level two 
evidence due to the quality of the study 
design in the original guidleine.33,36,139141However from these papers, only one 
paper139 explicitly constructed a 
decision rule that could be used in the 
acute setting to identify patients at risk 
of PCS. This rule identifies a high-risk 
group that has an 89% risk of PCS and 
a low risk group with a risk of PCS of 
9%. Unfortunately 50% of patients then 
fall into a medium risk category, where 
the risk is 47% for PCS. Therefore the 
only category that may be of use for 
excluding patients from follow up is the 
low risk category, but this category was 
derived from only eleven patients.  
Therefore this study, although being the 
only paper to attempt the derivation of 
a rule is still really only of use to
