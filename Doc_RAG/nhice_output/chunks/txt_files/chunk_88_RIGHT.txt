Priority dispatch of emergency 
ambulances 
The use of an emergency medical 
dispatch (EMD) system is controversial.  
The EMD system requires a form of 
telephone assessment carried out by 
ambulance dispatchers to determine the 
urgency of the emergency. A recent 
systematic review found little evidence 
on the effectiveness of EMD in terms of 
improved clinical outcomes.70 However, 
a recent study on the acceptability of 
EMD in a UK context found increased 
satisfaction among callers to the 999 
service. The amount of first aid advice 
and general information received by the 
service users increased while satisfaction 
with response times was maintained.71 
Given these findings no change to 
current practice in EMD is recommended 
in these guidelines. This stance will be 
reviewed in forthcoming versions of 
these guidelines depending on advances 
in the literature.
