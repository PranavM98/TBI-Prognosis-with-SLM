neurosurgical unit irrespective of any 
need for a neurosurgical operation 
instead of receiving treatment at the 
emergency department. This study found 
data which suggests that treatment in a 
neurosciences centre offers a better 
strategy for the management of severe 
head injury. This study did not address 
direct transfer from the scene, only interhospital transfers. There is 
evidence135,136 which suggests good 
recovery, better mortality and morbidity 
rates amongst severely injured patients 
who bypass the DGH and go to the 
neurosciences unit. However another 
study66 suggests very little difference.  
7.8.5 
Rationale behind recommendation 
A slight amendent to the previous 
recommendation was required (see 
7.8.6). The GDG felt that there is 
evidence to support a recommendation 
for severely head injured to receive 
treatment in a neurosurgical unit 
irrespective of any need for a 
neurosurgical operation and have 
included an amendent to the 
recommendation below 7.8.6. The GDG 
agreed that the studies66,135,136 did not 
provide enough evidence for this 
question to demonstrate that all patients 
should be sent directly to receive 
treatment in a neurosurgical unit 
irrespective of any need for a 
neurosurgical operation. This is because 
the GDG recognises that this would 
require a major shift of resources of 
between an additional 84,000 and 
105,000 bed days to neurosurgery from 
the existing general surgical, 
orthopaedic, emergency department, 
paediatric and geriatric services that
