improvement in hospital times and use of 
the London HEMS. 
Report conclusions 
The bypass protocol proposed is based 
on the 20 minutes of distance from a 
Multi-Specialty Centre, as this time gives 
the best trade-off between longer time 
to Critical Interventions, and shorter time 
to Definitive Intervention. However, the 
best balance between these opposing 
effects had to be struck by clinical 
judgement, as little evidence was 
available.  
The report recommended that within a 
20 minute drive time of an appropriate 
specialist unit, a patient should be driven 
directly to the specialist unit rather than 
to the local hospital, and that a triage 
system for London should be gradually 
introduced, allowing training of prehospital personnel and evaluation of the 
effectiveness of each of the triage 
criteria. For head injury the initial 
criterion could be based on GCS and 
additional criteria could then be added. 
This would avoid the flooding of MultiSpecialty Centres. 
Review 
The report has a number of limitations: 
x The model, especially the target times, 
was based more on expert judgement 
than hard evidence of clinical 
effectiveness. 
x In reality there will be a continuum of 
risk rather than a time cut-off. 
x The model assumes that the specialist 
hospital has a range of different
