Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults.

GDG agreed that whilst there are not 
enough resources for all head injury 
patients to go to a neurosciences centre, 
we should aspire to improve the rate of 
transfer. The GDG opinion therefore is 
to propose this area for further research 
(see section 7.9.1). 
7.8.6 
Recommendation 
For adults: 
[Amended] Local guidelines on the 
transfer of patients with head injuries 
should be drawn up between the 
referring hospital trusts, the 
neuroscience unit and the local 
ambulance service, and should 
recognise that: 
- transfer would benefit all patients 
with serious head injuries (GCS Â” 8), 
irrespective of the need for 
neurosurgery 
- if transfer of those who do not 
require neurosurgery is not possible, 
ongoing liaison with the neuroscience 
unit over clinical management is 
essential.  
[NEW] The possibility of occult 
extracranial injuries should be 
considered for the multiply injured 
adult, and he or she should not be 
transferred to a service that is unable 
to deal with other aspects of trauma. 
There should be a designated 
consultant in the referring hospital 
with responsibility for establishing 
arrangements for the transfer of 
patients with head injuries to a
