Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
neck. NEXUS identifies focal neurology 
as high risk and the Canadian rule 
identifies paraesthesia as high risk. 
The main difference in the nature of the 
rules lies in the use of active neck 
rotation. NEXUS did not consider 
removal of the collar for examination as 
a safe procedure prior to imaging, 
whereas the Canadian rule found low 
risk criteria for safely performing active 
neck rotation, a manoeuvre that has an 
excellent specificity for exclusion of neck 
fracture. Due to this great difference in 
ethos, there are many differences in the 
two rules. The Canadians cite age 
greater than or equal to 65 years and 
dangerous mechanism as indications for 
immediate radiography, whereas these 
were not identified in the NEXUS rule. 
The Canadian rule also cites several 
specific low risk factors for the simple 
neck rotation test. The NEXUS rule uses 
painful distracting injury and intoxication 
to select patients for radiography, 
whereas the Canadian investigators did 
not find these as useful as their other 
high risk factors 
The two rules differ greatly in their 
approach to the assessment of patients 
at risk for a cervical injury. The NEXUS 
study is a much larger cohort and 
includes children and those who had a 
GCS score of less than 15. The 
Canadian rule is however much more 
specific and provides a validated rule 
that safely excludes 42% of patients 
who sustained a head injury from 
radiography.  Neither rule however fully 
describes how to diagnose the fracture 
once someone has been identified as at 
high risk, because plain radiography is
