Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
comprehensive monitoring established 
before transfer to avoid complications 
during the journey. A who is patient 
persistently hypotensive, despite 
resuscitation, should not be 
transported until the cause of the 
hypotension has been identified and 
the patient stabilised.  
All patients with a GCS less than or 
equal to 8 requiring transfer to a 
neuroscience unit should be intubated 
and ventilated as should any patients 
with the indications detailed in the 
recommendation below. 
[Amended] Intubation and ventilation 
should be used immediately in the 
following circumstances: 
- Coma – not obeying commands, not 
speaking, not eye opening (that is, 
GCS  8). 
- Loss of protective laryngeal reflexes. 
- Ventilatory insufficiency as judged 
by blood gases: hypoxaemia (PaO2< 
13 kPa on oxygen) or hypercarbia 
(PaCO2 > 6 kPa). 
- Spontaneous hyperventilation 
causing PaCO2 < 4 kPa. 
- Irregular respirations.  
[Amended] Intubation and ventilation 
should be used before the start of the 
journey in the following 
circumstances: 
- Significantly deteriorating conscious 
level (one or more points on the motor 
score), even if not coma. 
- Unstable fractures of the facial 
skeleton.
