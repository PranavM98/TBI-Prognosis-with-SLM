Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
x The assessment of amnesia will not be 
possible in pre-verbal children and is 
unlikely to be possible in any child aged 
under 5 years. 
The 2003 Guideline Development 
Group considered these 
recommendations see below to be 
interim and dependant on future 
research which was likely to appear in 
the literature in time for the update. 
These include the validation phase of the 
Canadian CT head rules, and a new 
clinical decision instrument based upon 
the NEXUS II study. The latter study 
recruited approximately 15,000 
patients to the overall project 
(derivation and validation)89.  
In relation to selection of patients for 
imaging of the head, a recent level two 
study has produced a clinical decision 
rule for use in children aged under 2 
years. It is likely that a validation study 
for this rule will appear in the near 
future, although methodological concerns 
will remain about the derivation phase 
(see Appendix i). A strong predictive 
power is ascribed to scalp haematoma 
in young children.90 
The literature on skull X-ray in children 
and infants indicates that, as with adults, 
the specificity of skull X-ray is too low to 
be the primary investigation (that is, the 
absence of skull fracture does not 
predict absence of intra-cranial 
complications).20,91,92 In studies which 
have included both children and adults, 
there is evidence that adult rules can be 
safely applied to children, but these 
studies have suffered from statistical 
power problems.93 The evidence
