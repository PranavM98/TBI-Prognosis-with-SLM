Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
reproducibility of ‘presence of 
intoxication’ and ‘distracting painful 
injuries’. These criticisms have not been 
accepted by the developers of the 
NEXUS rules, who argued that that the 
data collected by the Canadian group 
was inadequate to properly test the 
NEXUS criteria (Hoffman JR, personal 
communication). 
The main difference in the performance 
of the rules lies in specificity. The NEXUS 
rule has a specificity of 13% (95% CI: 
12.8-13.0) whereas the specificity of the 
Canadian cervical spine rule is 42% 
(95% CI: 40-44) for clinically significant 
injuries. In addition the Canadian 
cervical spine rule detected 27 out of 28 
clinically insignificant spine fractures. 
Because of the very large difference in 
specificity the ordering rate produced 
by the two rules is also markedly 
different. The NEXUS rule requires an 
87% three-view plain radiography rate, 
whereas the Canadian cervical spine 
rule requires a 58% rate. It is important 
to note that NEXUS only found 498 of 
the 818 cervical spine abnormalities on 
plain radiography, as a very high 
number of plain radiographs were of 
inadequate quality. Another issue of 
concern is that 23 of the cervical 
fractures that were categorised as high 
risk by the NEXUS rule had plain 
radiographs that missed the fracture 
even though they were of good quality. 
These fractures were only picked up as 
further imaging was performed. The 
Canadian cervical spine rule paper did 
not comment on how many of their plain 
radiographs were of inadequate 
quality, and therefore how many
