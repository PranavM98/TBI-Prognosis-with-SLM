Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
Thus the model takes into account the 
increased costs of rehabilitation and 
care due to people surviving under 
direct transport, who would not survive 
under the current system. It could be that 
costs of neurosurgery and intensive care 
are also increased if patients are now 
making it to the NSH who would have 
died in transit. Since we do not have 
data on the timing of deaths, we have 
not included such costs in the base case. 
However, for a sensitivity analysis we 
added on the cost of 3 days of level 3 
neurosurgical intensive care for each 
additional survivor. The costs of care in 
an ICU were calculated from the NHS 
Reference Costs 2005-2006177 at 
Â£1,338 per day. 
Calculating incremental cost 
For Model A the incremental cost is 
calculated as follows: 
Incremental cost = CostNSU - CostDGH  
CostNSU = (PNSUGR x (RHGR + LEGR x 
ACCGR))  
+ (PNSUD x (RHD + LED x ACCD)) 
CostDGH = (PDGHGR x (RHGR + (LEGR x 
ACCGR))) 
+( PDGHD x (RHD + (LED x 
ACCD))) 
+ TC 
where 
CostNSU = the expected cost per patient 
associated with direct transport to the 
NSU 
CostDGH = the expected cost per patient 
associated with a secondary referral to 
the NSU from a DGH 
PNSUGR, PNSUD = the proportion of 
survivors in good recovery or 
mild/severe disability at 6 months with 
direct transport to the NSU 
PDGHGR, PDGHD = the proportion of 
survivors in good recovery or 
mild/severe disability at 6 months with a 
secondary referral 
RHGR, RHD = the cost of rehabilitation by 
GOS state at 6 months (where D is both 
mild disability and severe disability 
combined) 
LEGR, LED = the discounted life 
expectancy of patients by GOS state at 
6 months
