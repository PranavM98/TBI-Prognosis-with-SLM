savings might not be transferable to a 
UK NHS setting.  As the cost of CT 
scanning, as with most medical care, is 
lower in the UK, if it is cost-effective in 
the USA then it is likely to be costeffective for the NHS.  However, the cost 
savings from paralysis care averted are 
also likely to be lower.

Addendum 2007  â€“ Direct transport from 
injury scene to a specialist neurosciences 
centre 
11.6.1 Literature review 
We did not find any cost-effectiveness 
evidence for this question but we did 
find two simulation models, which we will 
refer to as the London and Staffordshire 
models.  We have reviewed these 
models in some detail, as follows. 
11.6.2 London model 
The report196 summarises the findings of 
a review conducted by the London 
Severe Injury Working Group focusing 
on the Trauma services provided in 
London, including care, treatment and 
transfer of severely injured patients. 
Severe injury was defined as the need 
for Intensive Care.   
The analysis of the current service 
highlights some key issues:  
x high secondary referral rate (two 
thirds of the severely injured patients 
group),  
x evidence of problems associated with 
such transfers (adverse clinical events 
during transfer, delay to definitive 
intervention, low level of staff and 
standard of care), and
