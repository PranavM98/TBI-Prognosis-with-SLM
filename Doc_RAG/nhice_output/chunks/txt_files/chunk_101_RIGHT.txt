patients who will need CT imaging of the 
head. 
In order to provide guidance that covers 
all possibilities, the seven point 
Canadian CT rule has been slightly 
adapted as follows. 
x Patients with post-traumatic seizure, 
focal neurological deficit or 
coagulopathy should be included in the 
x Patients with non-symptomatic risk 
factors (that is, age greater than or 
equal to 65 years, coagulopathy, 
dangerous mechanism of injury) should 
at least have had an instance of loss of 
consciousness or amnesia (that is, the 
main signs and symptoms used to screen 
patients for inclusion in the Canadian 
CT-head rule study) before receiving CT. 
This is to prevent the possibility of 
patients with no signs or symptoms 
receiving a CT. 
x As noted above, falls from three feet 
have been changed to falls from 
greater than 1 metre, to ensure 
consistency with other rules adopted by 
this guideline. A lower threshold for 
height of falls should be used when 
dealing with infants and young children 
(that is, aged under 5 years). See 
section 4.8. 
x Clinical judgement regarding the 
cause of vomiting in those aged under or 
equal to 12 years should be used, and 
this judgement should guide whether 
imaging is considered necessary.
