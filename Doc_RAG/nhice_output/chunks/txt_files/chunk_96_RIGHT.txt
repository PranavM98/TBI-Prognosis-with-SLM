Both rules include an age category. The 
New Orleans rules specify age greater 
than 60 years, and the Canadian rules 
specify age greater than or equal to 65 
years. 
Both rules agree that post-traumatic 
seizure should be an indication for CT 
imaging, but the Canadian rules 
considered this an a priori variable, 
whereas it is explicitly included in the 
New Orleans rules. 
It is also important to note that 
coagulopathy is not included in either set 
of rules but for very different reasons. 
The Canadian study excluded these 
patients deliberately, presumably 
because they were considered a priori 
candidates for CT imaging. The New 
Orleans rules included these patients but 
did not have enough power to detect a 
significant predictive effect. The New 
Orleans study explicitly states that this 
variable was not considered by their 
study and imply that it should be 
considered an important predictive 
variable. A further exclusion from both 
samples is focal neurological deficit (this 
is not completely clear from the New 
Orleans study) again, presumably 
because CT imaging of the head for 
these patients was considered noncontroversial. 
The rules differ in their treatment of 
amnesia. The Canadian rules include 
pre-traumatic amnesia (retrograde – for 
events before the injury) of greater than 
30 minutes, whereas the New Orleans 
rules include post-traumatic ‘short-term 
memory deficits’ (anterograde - for 
events after the injury). The Canadian
