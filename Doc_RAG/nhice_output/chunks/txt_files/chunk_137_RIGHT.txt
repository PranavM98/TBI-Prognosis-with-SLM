admitted to hospital experiences 
persisting problems, there should be 
an opportunity available for referral 
from primary care to an out-patient 
appointment with a professional 
trained in assessment and 
management of sequelae of brain 
injury (for example, clinical 
psychologist, neurologist, 
neurosurgeon, specialist in 
rehabilitation medicine).  
These recommendations are based on 
level five evidence and are considered 
to be grade D recommendations.

Prognosis in severe head injury 
A recent systematic review focusing only 
on severe head injuries examined 
evidence on early indicators of 
prognosis.154 The review found that 
certain variables had a high positive 
predictive value for poor prognosis.  
While this level one evidence is useful in 
identifying patients at highest risk for 
poor outcome, it is unclear what course 
of action should be pursued with these 
patients. Guidelines on the rehabilitation 
of adults following traumatic brain injury 
have been prepared by the British 
Society of Rehabilitation Medicine. These 
are based on a full systematic review of 
the literature as well as drawing on the 
recommendations of existing consensus 
documents. The guidelines were 
published in December 2003155 and 
include information on the rehabilitation 
of patients following acquired brain 
injury. The contents of this guideline are 
therefore beyond the scope of this 
guideline.
