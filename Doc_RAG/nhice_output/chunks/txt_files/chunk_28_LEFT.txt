Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
20% of injuries although again there are 
regional differences. Alcohol is 
associated with around 50% of all adult 
head injuries: the alcohol may have been 
consumed by either the injured person or 
the person causing the incident. Firearm 
trauma to the head surpassed motor 
vehicles as the single largest cause of 
death from traumatic head injury in 
1990 in the USA. However, gunshot 
trauma to the head is not a common 
cause for attendance to hospital. This is 
largely due to the fact that 90% of 
gunshot wounds to the head are fatal 
and that two-thirds of people injured in 
this way will not reach hospital. The 
prevalence of death due to any 
traumatic head injury is 20 per 100,000 
in the USA, which is double the rate in 
the UK. Firearm-related deaths account 
for 8 per 100,000 of these 
deaths.19,22,37-40 
Comparisons with a Canadian 
population are important at this stage 
because of the importance of Canadian 
evidence to these guidelines. A large 
Canadian study on people with GCS 
greater than 12 following a head injury 
found that 31% of these people had 
sustained falls (comparable with UK 
estimates) and 43% had been in some 
form of road traffic accident (higher 
than the estimate of 25% for the UK). 
Assaults, by contrast, accounted for only 
11% of the Canadian sample, 
compared to estimates of 30-50% for 
the UK. The proportion of males in this 
study was similar to that observed in the 
UK (69%).25 The Guideline Development 
Group is of the opinion that a head 
injury episode is more likely to have
