disabled patients, the long term care 
was the community care support 
required after rehabilitation and it was 
based on the cost of a support worker. 
Similarly, the long term annual cost for 
the moderate disability group was 
calculated from the weekly cost of care 
three months after discharge from the 
rehabilitation. Patients having a good 
recovery were assumed not to incur any 
long term costs. Patients in a vegetative 
state were assumed to have the same 
annual care costs as those who are in the 
severe disability state.    
Care costs were discounted at a rate of 
3.5% per year, as required by NICE.
