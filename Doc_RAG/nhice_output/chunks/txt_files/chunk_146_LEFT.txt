parameters to the size of the patient. 
The doses involved for all age groups 
may now be smaller due to increased 
awareness of this need and the 
introduction of multislice helical CT, as 
has been seen for CT head scans.

Summary of effective doses from CT and 
conventional X-ray examinations of the 
head and cervical spine 
A summary of estimates of the effective 
doses received by adults, children and 
infants from CT and conventional 
radiographic examinations of the head 
and cervical spine are detailed in Table 
9.1 below. The estimates for CT head 
examinations are based on the 2003 
survey161 and reflect UK practice at that 
time for selecting CT scan parameters 
for adult and paediatric patients. The 
estimates for CT cervical spine 
examinations are based on the 1989 
survey for adult patients and paediatric 
enhancement factors that assume that 
the same CT technique parameters are 
used for children and adults (which has 
been common practice until recently). 
They consequently are likely to 
overestimate patient doses from current 
practice.   
The estimates for conventional 
radiographic examinations are based 
on typical effective doses for adults in a 
further NRPB survey166. 
Effective doses for children from these 
radiographic examinations have been 
assumed to be the same as those for 
adults, since the technique parameters 
are usually adapted to the size of the 
patient.
