3.8.5 
Patients with normal imaging of the 
head 
3.8.5.1 
After normal imaging of the head, the 
clinician may conclude that the risk of 
clinically important brain injury 
requiring hospital care is low enough 
to warrant discharge, as long as the 
patient has returned to GCS equal to 
15, and no other factors that would 
warrant a hospital admission are 
present (for example, drug or alcohol 
intoxication, other injuries, shock, 
suspected non-accidental injury, 
meningism, cerebrospinal fluid leak) 
and there are appropriate support 
structures for safe discharge and for 
subsequent care (for example, 
competent supervision at home). (D) 
3.8.6 
Patients with normal imaging of the 
cervical spine 
3.8.6.1 After normal imaging of the cervical 
spine the clinician may conclude that 
the risk of injury to the cervical spine 
is low enough to warrant discharge, as 
long as the patient has returned to GCS 
equal to 15 and their clinical 
examination is normal, and no other 
factors that would warrant a hospital 
admission are present (for example, 
drug or alcohol intoxication, other 
injuries, shock, suspected nonaccidental injury, meningism, 
cerebrospinal fluid leak) and there are 
appropriate support structures for safe 
discharge and for subsequent care (for 
example, competent supervision at 
home). (D)
