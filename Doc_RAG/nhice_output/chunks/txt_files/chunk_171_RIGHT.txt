rule. This suggests a combined impact of 
£31 saved per patient. For England and 
Wales, assuming an incidence of head 
injury of around 700,000 cases a year, 
of which 54% satisfy the criteria for 
scanning, a modest saving of £12.1m 
that could be reinvested in the health 
service would result. However, we should 
be very cautious about this figure. The 
longer term impact of changing imaging 
strategies on health outcomes and health 
service costs is even less certain. Staff 
shortages in radiology mean that 
implementation of these changes could 
take some time or else use up extra 
resources. Another reason why these cost 
savings might not be realised in the short 
term is that they are likely to require 
investment in new CT scanning 
equipment. 
It is probable that we have not taken 
into account fully the implementation 
costs of the guideline. To some extent 
this is true, as our remit does not include 
the details of implementation. For 
example, we acknowledge that full 
implementation of the guideline will 
require staff training, the cost of which 
we have not been in a position to 
quantify.   
It is also possible that the costs 
incorporated into our cost analyses do 
not reflect the real costs of the services. 
For example, the increased utilisation of 
CT scanners may necessitate the 
purchase of additional scanners, 
although the capital cost of CT scanners 
should be incorporated into the unit costs 
that we have used in our costeffectiveness model. There is also a 
possibility of the expansion of out of
