involve about 25 times more radiation 
exposure. In the 1998 UK survey, the 
eyes, thyroid and breasts typically 
received doses of about 50 mGy, 2 
mGy and 0.03 mGy, respectively, from 
a head CT scan161. Since the effective 
dose for a CT head scan has come down 
by about 20% between the 1989 and 
2003 surveys, these organ doses have 
probably seen a similar reduction.  
For comparison, the average natural 
background radiation level in the UK 
gives rise to an annual effective dose of 
2.2 mSv, with regional averages ranging 
from 1.5 mSv to 7.5 mSv per year.

Patient doses from cervical spine CT 
A small proportion of patients are 
currently deemed suitable for CT 
examination of the cervical spine, usually 
carried out in conjunction with CT of the 
head.  Unfortunately cervical spine scans 
were not included in the 2003 patient 
dose survey but the mean value for the 
effective dose on adult patients 
receiving CT of the cervical spine in the 
1989 UK national survey 161 was 2.6 
mSv. This compares to 1.8 mSv for CT of 
the head alone in the 1989 survey.  The 
effective dose for cervical spine CT is 
higher because the thyroid is directly 
irradiated (mean thyroid dose equal to 
44 mGy). NRPB models167 indicate that 
the effective dose received by children 
and infants from head and neck CT 
scans is higher, if the scan parameters 
are unchanged from those used on adult 
patients. The increase amounts to a 
factor of 2.3 for newborns, a factor of 
1.5 for 5 year olds and a factor of 1.2 
for 10 year olds. These factors 
emphasise the need to match the scan
