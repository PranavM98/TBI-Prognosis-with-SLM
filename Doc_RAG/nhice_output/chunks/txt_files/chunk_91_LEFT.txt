Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
most accurate tool for use in the initial 
diagnosis of head injury. This review 
also investigates whether there are other 
imaging tools that have been compared 
to CT and are accurate in identifying 
head injury. The outcome measures for 
including studies for this review were 
sensitivity and specificity of the imaging 
technique with or without mortality, 
disability, neurological outcome, hospital 
duration, and cost. 
6.3.2 
Clinical evidence  
In the earlier version of the head injury 
guideline no evidence was found that 
addressed this question. However in this 
update one study was retrieved75  in 
children and no evidence was retrieved 
for adults. This study75 examined the 
diagnostic value of physical examination 
(including neurological exam) for 
positive CT scan findings in 98 children 
(2-16 years) children with closed head 
injury. This prospective diagnostic study 
(level II evidence) evaluated physical 
examination using CT as the reference 
standard. This study was based in San 
Diego, USA. Halley et al conclude that 
physical examination cannot identify all 
cases of brain injury that are 
demonstrated on CT imaging. Physical 
examination was demonstrated in this 
study as having poor sensitivity of 0.69 
(CI: 0.42-0.87) and specificity of 0.4 (CI: 
0.30-0.51) for identifying patients with 
brain injury but this presupposes that CT 
is 100% accurate.
