clinically important brain injuries is CT 
imaging of the head. (A) 
3.5.2.2 
For safety, logistic and resource 
reasons, magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) scanning is not currently 
indicated as the primary investigation 
for clinically important brain injury in 
patients who have sustained a head 
injury, although it is recognised that 
additional information of importance 
to the patientâ€™s prognosis can 
sometimes be detected using MRI. (D) 
3.5.2.3 
MRI is contraindicated in both head 
and cervical spine investigations 
unless there is absolute certainty that 
the patient does not harbour an 
incompatible device, implant or 
foreign body. (D) 
3.5.2.4 
There should be appropriate 
equipment for maintaining and 
monitoring the patient within the MRI 
environment and all staff involved 
should be aware of the dangers and 
necessary precautions for working 
near an MRI scanner.  (D) 
3.5.2.5 
[NEW] Plain X-rays of the skull should 
not be used to diagnose significant 
brain injury without prior discussion 
with a neuroscience unit. However, 
they are useful as part of the skeletal 
survey in children presenting with 
suspected non-accidental injury.  
3.5.2.6 
[NEW] Unless the CT result is required 
within 1 hour, it is acceptable to admit 
a patient for effective overnight 
observation and delay the CT scan 
until the next morning if the patient 
presents out of hours and any of the 
following risk factors are present in
