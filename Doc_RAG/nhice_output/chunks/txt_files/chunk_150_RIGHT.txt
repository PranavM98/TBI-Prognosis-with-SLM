procedures.173-175 There is still some 
debate over some of the specific 
methods of economic evaluation in 
healthcare but essentially there are six  
steps to evaluating the relative 
efficiency of any procedure. 
1. Identify the target group (for 
example, patients attending emergency 
departments with GCS greater than 12), 
the procedure to be evaluated (for 
example, head CT scanning) and its 
alternative strategy (for example, skull 
X-ray). 
2. Identify all the important health and 
resource outcomes that are likely to 
differ between the procedure and its 
alternative. 
3. Measure the differences in identified 
health and resource outcomes. 
4. Estimate the value of the health gain 
and the value of the resource use.  
(Resource use is valued in terms of its 
monetary value, its economic cost.  
Health gain is sometimes valued in 
monetary terms but more often a nonpecuniary measure such as the qualityadjusted life-year, QALY, is used).
