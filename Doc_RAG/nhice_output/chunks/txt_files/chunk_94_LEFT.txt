Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
clinical prediction rule was the best for 
selecting patients for CT imaging who 
had experienced a minor head injury. 
This question was deemed important as 
the current use of CT for minor head 
injury is increasing rapidly; it is highly 
variable and may be inefficient. The 
interventions included within this review 
were any prediction rule ranging from 
NEXUS, NOC, CHR and any other new 
rules. The studies were included if the 
outcomes included sensitivity and 
specificity of prediction rules.

Clinical evidence  
In the previous guideline, four studies 
discussed decision rules for selecting 
patients for CT imaging which attempted 
to identify those at a high risk for 
traumatic brain injury (usually 
ICH).19,24,25,55On examination of these 
studies it was felt that one study had 
validated the rules in a population with 
a much lower prevalence of abnormal 
CT scans than an average UK 
population24 and this study was not 
considered. A second study described a 
rule that had only a 65% sensitivity for 
abnormal CT scan results and was also 
not considered further.55 The sensitivity 
of these rules have been questioned in 
another study.82 
The remaining two sets of rules, the 
Canadian CT-rules25 and the ‘New 
Orleans’ criteria are now considered.19 
Two versions of the Canadian rules are 
available, a five point version designed 
to detect ‘need for neurological 
intervention’, and a seven point version 
designed to detect ‘clinically important 
brain injury’. The remit of this guideline is 
on the latter outcome, and the seven
