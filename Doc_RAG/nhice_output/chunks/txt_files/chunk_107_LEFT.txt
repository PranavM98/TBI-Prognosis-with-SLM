Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
the sensitivities for X-rays we reviewed 
the seven studies95,111-116 individually. 
The patient populations varied between 
the studies. Three studies95,112,115 
selected only the most severely injured 
patients (altered mental status or those 
requiring admission to the intensive care 
unit). One study116 selected only high risk 
blunt trauma patients. Another studyâ€™s113 
inclusion criteria was for blunt trauma 
patients with physical findings of 
posterior midline neck tenderness, 
altered mental status or neurological 
deficit. The final two studies111,114 
reviewed patients that had suffered a 
cervical spine fracture or patients that 
had both CT and X-ray imaging for 
suspected cervical spine fracture. The 
later study111 reported a prevalence of 
cervical spine injury of 76% (19 of 25 
included patients).  The sensitivities in 
these seven studies ranged from 39 to 
76%. The studies varied in the number 
of X-ray views (3 and 5) and three were 
retrospective and four prospective. The 
meta-analysis108 evidence supports the 
use of cervical spine CT as the initial 
screening test in high risk patients.  
A prospective cohort study109 was 
retrieved. This was a small study (N=34) 
that selected high risk blunt trauma 
patients in a US trauma centre. The 
study used X-rays to identify fractures 
of the cervical spine and CT scans were 
used as the reference standard. The 
sensitivity of X-rays (3 view) was 93.3% 
and the specificity was 95.0%.  
The final prospective cohort study110 
comprised 442 unconscious intubated 
blunt trauma patients in the UK. The 
reference standard was MRI and/or
