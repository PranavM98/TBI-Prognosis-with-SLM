Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
As a minimum, CT should cover any 
areas of concern or uncertainty on 
plain film or clinical grounds.  
With modern multislice scanners the 
whole cervical spine can be scanned 
at high resolution with ease and 
multiplanar reformatted images 
generated rapidly. Facilities for 
multiplanar reformatting and 
interactive viewing should be 
available. 
MRI is indicated in the presence of 
neurological signs and symptoms 
referable to the cervical spine and if 
there is suspicion of vascular injury 
(for example, subluxation or 
displacement of the spinal column, 
fracture through foramen 
transversarium or lateral processes, 
posterior circulation syndromes).  
MRI may add important information 
about soft tissue injuries associated 
with bony injuries demonstrated by 
plain films and/or CT.  
MRI has a role in the assessment of 
ligamentous and disc injuries 
suggested by plain films, CT or clinical 
findings. 
In CT, the occipital condyle region 
should be routinely reviewed on 'bone 
windows' for patients who sustained a 
head injury.  Reconstruction of 
standard head images onto a high 
resolution bony algorithm is readily 
achieved with modern CT scanners. 
In patients who have sustained high 
energy trauma or are showing signs of 
lower cranial nerve palsy, particular
