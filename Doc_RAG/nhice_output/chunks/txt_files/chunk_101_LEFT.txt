Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
admission. However, none of the 
economic evidence has taken into 
account the impact of the increased 
radiation exposure.   
Child Rules 
The 4 new studies53,85-87 within this 
review compared different decision rules 
in children. One study85 concluded that 
the decision rule derived in the large 
NEXUS II cohort performed with similar 
high sensitivity among the subgroup of 
children who were included in this study. 
The second study86 found that CT use in 
children aged 5 years or older with 
minor head injury could be safely 
reduced by 23% by using a clinical 
decision rule previously validated in 
adults. The Palchak study87 derived a 
clinical decision rule for the identification 
of children who should undergo CT after 
head injury. The final study53 derived a 
highly sensitive clinical decision rule for 
the identification of children who should 
undergo CT scanning after head injury. 
We did not find any economic evidence 
specific to children.

Rationale behind recommendation 
Two evidence based decision rules for 
selection of patients who have sustained 
a head injury for CT imaging of the 
head have been described.  There is no 
clear means of choosing one over the 
other, and the decision on which rule to 
choose was therefore based on 
consensus. Based on the Guideline 
Development Group consensus, it was 
decided that the seven point Canadian 
CT head rules should be used to identify
