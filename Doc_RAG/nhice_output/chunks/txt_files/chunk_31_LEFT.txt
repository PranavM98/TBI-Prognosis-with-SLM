was sufficient new evidence to prompt 
an update. This update affects a few 
recommendations within the original 
guideline.  
New evidence has been incorporated 
using the latest version of the NICE 
technical manual (April 2007). The 
original guideline was produced using 
standard methodology between 200103 prior to the first version of the NICE 
technical manual. In this update we have 
not sought to revisit previously reviewed 
literature and recommendations except 
in the areas that we are updating. The 
write up of sections that we have not 
updated has not been amended and we 
have added sections only where an 
update was needed. A guideline review 
is carried out at 2 years and a proposal 
will be put forward to the Guidelines 
Executive at NICE based on this review.

services. We base our clinical guidelines 
on the best available research evidence, 
with the aim of improving the quality of 
healthcare. We use predetermined and 
systematic methods to identify and 
evaluate the evidence relating to 
specific clinical questions.
