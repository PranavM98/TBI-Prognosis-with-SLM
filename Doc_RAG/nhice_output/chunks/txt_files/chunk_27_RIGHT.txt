input from rehabilitation services. A 
second large UK study examined the 
outcome of patients attending a minor 
head injury clinic34. They saw 639 
patients who had originally presented 
with a minor head injury. Fifty-six per 
cent were not back to work at 2 weeks, 
and 12% had not returned to work at 6 
weeks. In addition at 6 weeks many had 
persisting symptoms including headache 
(13%), memory loss (15%) and 
concentration problems (14%). These 
data have been reproduced in other 
countries.35,36

Cause of injury 
In the UK 70-88% of all people that 
sustain a head injury are male, 10-19% 
are aged greater than or equal to 65 
years and 40-50% are children. Falls 
(22-43%) and assaults (30-50%) are 
the most common cause of a minor head 
injury in the UK, followed by road traffic 
accidents (~25%). Alcohol may be 
involved in up to 65% of adult head 
injuries. Of note, road traffic accidents 
account for a far greater proportion of 
moderate to severe head injuries. Also 
there are marked regional variations, 
especially in assaults and the 
involvement of alcohol, but the incidence 
of penetrating head trauma remains 
low. The incidence of death due to head 
injury in the UK is 6-10 per 100,000 per 
annum.2-5,7 
In the USA 65-75% of people that 
sustain a head injury are male. The USA 
has a higher rate of road traffic 
accidents (~50%) and a lower rate of 
falls (20%-30%) than the UK, reflecting 
the difference in car usage in the two 
countries. Assaults account for around
