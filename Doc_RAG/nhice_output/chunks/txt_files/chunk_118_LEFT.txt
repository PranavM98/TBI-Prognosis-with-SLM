Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
- All emergency department clinicians 
involved in the assessment of patients 
with a head injury should be capable 
of assessing the presence or absence 
of the risk factors in the guidance on 
patient selection and urgency for 
imaging (head and cervical spine – 
see previous recommendations). 
Training should be available as 
required to ensure that this is the case.  
- Patients presenting to the emergency 
department with impaired 
consciousness (GCS less than 15) 
should be assessed immediately by a 
trained member of staff. 
- In patients with a GCS less than or 
equal to 8 there should be early 
involvement of an anaesthetist or 
critical care physician to provide 
appropriate airway management, as 
described in section 7.8.6, and to 
assist with resuscitation. 
- All patients presenting to an 
emergency departments with a head 
injury should be assessed by a trained 
member of staff within a maximum of 
15 minutes of arrival at hospital. Part 
of this assessment should establish 
whether they are high risk or low risk 
for clinically important brain injury 
and/or cervical spine injury, using the 
guidance on patient selection and 
urgency for imaging (head and 
cervical spine – see previous 
recommendations). 
[Amended] In patients considered to 
be at high risk for clinically important 
brain injury and/or cervical spine 
injury, assessment should be extended
