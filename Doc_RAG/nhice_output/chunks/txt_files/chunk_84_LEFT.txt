Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
- The individual components of the 
GCS should be described in all 
communications and every note and 
should always accompany the total 
score. 
- The paediatric version of the GCS 
should include a ‘grimace’ alternative 
to the verbal score to facilitate scoring 
in pre-verbal or intubated patients. 
- Best practice in paediatric coma 
observation and recording as detailed 
by the National Paediatric 
Neuroscience Benchmarking Group 
should be followed at all times. These 
principles are detailed in Appendix N. 
These recommendations are based on 
level five evidence and are considered 
to be grade D recommendations.

Glasgow Coma Scale score 
It is well established that the risk of 
intracranial complications and of 
subsequent need for surgery increases 
as GCS score declines.15,25,46A recent 
study estimated that the rate of clinically 
important brain injury in hospital 
attenders who had experienced some 
loss of consciousness and/or amnesia 
since their head injury increased from 
5% with an initial GCS equal to 15, to 
17% for GCS equal to 14, and to 41% 
for GCS equal to 13.62 A further study 
on paediatric head injury found that a 
GCS less than 13 was a significant 
predictor of an abnormal CT scan in 
children with head injury aged 14 years 
or younger.63
