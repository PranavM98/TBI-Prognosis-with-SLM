had higher expected survival than a 
strategy of sending all patients to the 
nearest emergency department but 
strategies 2-6 were the most effective. 
Among these strategies, strategy 4 
(direct transport of patients with critical 
head injury, AIS=5) required the least 
number of patients being diverted to 
specialist centres. The results were not 
sensitive to the parameters that were 
determined by expert opinion. 
An important limitation that was 
acknowledged by the authors was that 
AIS score is determined after treatment 
and therefore assessment of patients at 
the scene of the injury is less accurate. 
The implication is that the survival gain 
observed in this model is probably 
larger than can be achieved in reality, 
although the pattern should be the same. 
There are different costs associated with 
each strategy and therefore a costeffectiveness analysis is needed to 
assess which of the 10 strategies is the 
most cost-effective. 
In conclusion, the simulation study shows 
that survival of severe head injury 
patients could be substantially improved 
by transporting patients directly from 
the injury scene to a hospital with a 
specialist neurosciences centre. Costeffectiveness of these strategies was 
determined as described in 11.6.4. 
Comparison with the London model 
The Staffordshire model went a step 
further than the London model by 
estimating the impact of different 
strategies on survival (as well as time) in 
order to trade-off the different 
outcomes.
