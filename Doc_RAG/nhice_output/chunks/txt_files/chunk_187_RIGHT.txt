injured patients in Shavelle 2001 200, to 
the general population of England and 
Wales, using the Life Tables. According 
to Shavelle, the SMR decreases during 
the first 4 years post-injury but remains 
constant afterwards. In Shavelle 2001 
the SMR was distinguished according to 
three levels of ambulation: a) none, b) 
some, c) stairs, which we matched 
approximately to the levels of disability 
of the GOS (a=SD, b=MD and c=GR).  
Life expectancy was discounted at a 
rate of 3.5% per year, as required by 
NICE. 
For our base case analysis we estimated 
life expectancy for men aged 40 (the 
average age of a patient in the 
Stevenson study). For our sensitivity 
analysis, we also calculated life-years 
for patients aged 20 and 60. 
Quality of life 
The utility scores in Table 11.19 are a 
measure of the quality of life associated 
with each of the health states on a scale 
from 0 (death) to 1 (perfect health). For 
the good recovery (GR) outcome, we 
used the EQ-5D score of 0.83 reported 
for the United Kingdom population 201. 
The other utility scores were taken from 
a decision analysis, Aoki 1998 202. The 
mean utilities for each GOS score were 
elicited from a sample of 140 subjects 
with a clinical background using the 
standard-gamble method. The GOS 
states in this study were expressed as 
the degree of disability due to brain 
damage caused by subarachnoid 
haemorrhage.
