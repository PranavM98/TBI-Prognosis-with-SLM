* Stiell et al25 propose discharging patients that have a negative CT scan, although they are only 
half way through their validation study, which applies this strategy. This figure is based on their 
prevalence of complications. 
 
Stiell et al have not yet put their model into practice; therefore the admission rate figure is 
provisional. For this model it was assumed that only those with a positive CT scan (ICH or other 
complication) would be admitted. Another problem was that Stiell et al had already excluded 
patients without any loss of consciousness or amnesia, whereas the UK paper had not. This 
problem was tackled by assuming that patients in the UK study who were discharged without a 
skull X-ray or CT scan were also very low risk (that is, had no loss of consciousness or amnesia). 
11.2.3 Modelling of cost-effectiveness – cervical spine injuries 
We compared the cost of the two alternative strategies identified as being derived using 
relatively high quality methods: 
x 
NEXUS study rule 122 
x 
Canadian cervical spine rule 52 
These systems evaluate all patients with head trauma, the same cohort as for the intracranial 
haematoma model. 
The expected cost for each strategy was calculated on the basis of the expected usage of 
cervical spine X-ray, and cervical spine CT scan. It was not possible to quantify differences in 
health outcomes and other cost outcomes (Table 11.4, outcomes 3-8). Usage figures were derived 
from the original studies.  In the case of the Canadian cervical spine rule, there has not been a 
validation study hence the figures are from the original derivation study. It was assumed that, for 
both strategies, 39% of X-rays are inadequate 122 and that these are followed up with a CT 
scan.
