differential diagnosis difficult. 19,54In 
addition, alcohol abuse can lead to 
hypoglycaemia, which can in turn lead to 
impaired consciousness. This may lead to 
the incorrect diagnosis of a developing 
intracranial trauma complication.

Headache 
Headache is a controversial variable in 
the evaluation of risk for intracranial 
complications. In some studies the 
variable has been an important 
predictor 19,55 but not in others.25,56 
Headache can be difficult to define both 
in terms of duration and severity, 
particularly in infants and young 
children.

Vomiting 
Vomiting is consistently identified as a 
high risk variable, but there is some 
controversy regarding the number of 
episodes required to qualify as highrisk.19,25,55,56 Vomiting is also quite 
common in infants and children and its 
predictive power is controversial in this 
age group. It has been estimated that 
around 16% of infants and children 
aged 12 years or less vomit after minor 
head injury, and the cause of vomiting 
often seems to be related to individual 
intrinsic factors (for example, previous 
tendency to vomit) rather than specific 
features of the head injury57. There are 
inconsistencies between the various prehospital advice services in their choice of 
the timescales and number of vomits 
which would arouse concern in children. 
This is a reflection of the lack of 
evidence on which to make a judgment. 
The GDG considered that in a child
