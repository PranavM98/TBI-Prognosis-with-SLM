Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
considerable benefits in terms of 
assuring clinicians as to the safety of this 
novel rule.  
6.11 
Piloting the new rules 
The process of implementing these 
guidelines is beyond the Guideline 
Development Group but it is 
recommended that the clinical decision 
rules advocated in this chapter be 
piloted and their usage and impact on 
health outcomes analysed at a small 
number of representative hospitals 
before being broadly adopted. The 
Guideline Development Group 2003 
were aware that both the head and 
cervical spine imaging rules advocated 
were derived from a Canadian sample, 
where the proportion of head injury 
episodes involving assaults and the 
influence of alcohol is apparently much 
lower, and the proportion involving road 
traffic accidents much higher, than in the 
UK. It is unclear how this could impact on 
CT ordering rates following adoption of 
the rules in a UK context.  
6.12 
Non-accidental injury in children 
These guidelines are not intended to 
cover the acute management of nonaccidental injury, but it is important that 
health professionals are aware that the 
head injury examination is an important 
opportunity to identify this problem. 
There is evidence that a distinct pattern 
of brain injuries is associated with nonaccidental injury in children. This results 
from the different mechanisms of injury 
in accidental versus non-accidental head 
injury.
