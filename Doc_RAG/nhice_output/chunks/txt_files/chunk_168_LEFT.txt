Helical CT cost an additional £37,000 
per paralysis averted in this group. This 
would imply that the helical CT strategy 
is cost saving when the very high cost of 
treating paralysis is taken into account. 
A retrospective cohort study with a 
historical control published in 2002 193 
evaluated a protocol of MRI scanning 
patients whose cervical spine had not 
been cleared within 72 hours. The 
control strategy was not clearly defined. 
This study was conducted in a specific 
population of patients consisting of 102 
children (age 0 to 17) who were 
intubated at the time of hospital 
admission and who remained in the 
intensive care unit for at least 3 days. 
Among the 51 patients in the control 
group, 19 underwent MRI, whereas it 
was required for 31 patients in the postprotocol group.  
The MRI group had reduced hospital 
charges (£18,000 vs £24,000; 
significance not reported) attributable to 
reduced stay in hospital and in intensive 
care. However, sample variation and a 
general trend over time towards 
reduced stay might explain this 
difference.

Discussion 
A simple cost model demonstrates that 
some strategies that increase head CT 
scanning could potentially reduce costs if 
patients that have a negative scan are 
discharged without admission. However, 
there are health outcomes and some 
additional changes to resource use that
