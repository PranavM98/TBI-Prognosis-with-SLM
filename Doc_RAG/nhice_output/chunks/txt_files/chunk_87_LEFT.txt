Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
5.5.6 
Recommendation 
[Amended] Patients who have 
sustained a head injury should be 
transported directly to a facility that 
has been identified as having the 
resources necessary to resuscitate, 
investigate and initially manage any 
patient with multiple injuries. It is 
expected that all acute hospitals and 
all neuroscience units accepting 
patients directly from an incident will 
have these resources, and that these 
resources will be appropriate for a 
patientâ€™s age. (Same as the 
recommendation in section 5.1) 
5.5.7 
Recommendations for research 
The GDG identified the following 
priority area for research. 
5.5.7.1 
Research Question 
Is the clinical outcome of head injury 
patients with a reduced level of 
consciousness improved by direct 
transport from the scene of injury to a 
tertiary centre with neurosciences 
facilities compared with the outcome of 
those who are transported initially to the 
nearest hospital without neurosurgical 
facilities? 
The aim of this study is to conduct a 
comparison of patient outcomes 
(mortality/morbidity) for those head 
injured patients that are transported 
directly to a centre with neurosciences 
facilities with the outcomes of those who 
are transported to the nearest hospital 
without neurosciences facilities, possibly 
necessitating a secondary transfer. 
Patients suffering from serious head 
injuries with a reduced level of
