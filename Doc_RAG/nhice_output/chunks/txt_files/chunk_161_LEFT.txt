Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults.

Litigation costs (9, see Table 11.2) 
It has been suggested that litigation 
might be reduced if more patients were 
scanned. However, Bramley et al 187 
have estimated that only one in 10,000 
patients subsequently turn out to have an 
intracranial haematoma after being 
discharged without a CT. Therefore the 
potential costs saved per patient 
screened are likely to be small.  It should 
also be born in mind that successful 
litigation usually arises out of 
organisations not abiding by guidelines.

Update 2007 
We found three new studies that 
evaluated diagnostic tools: a decision 
analysis188 and an RCT79 were 
comparing admission with CT scanning, 
and a case series189 was evaluating the 
use of head MRI as an addition to CT.   
A further three new studies evaluated 
diagnostic decision rules. We found two 
studies evaluating the implementation of 
the head CT rule recommended in the 
original edition of this guideline. A third 
study compared the Canadian Head CT 
Rule with various imaging strategies. 
A decision analysis188 compared CT 
scanning (and discharge after a 
negative scan) with admission in head 
injury patients with a GCS of 15 (mild 
head injury). They found the CT strategy 
to be cost saving compared with 
admission. The same team confirmed the 
results of this study with a randomised 
controlled trial of 2600 mild head injury 
patients791. Outcomes were followed up 
for three months. There were no 
differences in clinical outcomes (survival
