with the NEXUS rule were still present 
but were now more modest since 
radiology costs are lower. 
6.9.5 
Summary of evidence from 2007 
update 
The Canadian Cervical Spine Rule had a 
higher sensitivity than NEXUS low risk 
criteria and physician judgement. It 
should be noted that both studies123,124 
came from the Canadian Cervical Spine 
Rule group. There is no new evidence to 
support CT spine for people with mild 
head injuries. 
The Canadian Cervical Spine Rule still 
appears to be less costly than the 
NEXUS rule. 
6.9.6 
Rationale behind recommendation 
In the 2003 guideline two evidence 
based decision rules for selection of 
patients who sustained a head injury for 
imaging of the cervical spine have been 
described. There was no clear means of 
choosing one over the other, and the 
choice of rule was therefore based on 
consensus. Based on the Guideline 
Development Group 2003 consensus, it 
was decided that the Canadian cervical 
spine rules should be used to identify 
patients who will require imaging of the 
cervical spine. 
In order to provide guidance that covers 
all possibilities, the Canadian cervical 
spine rule had been slightly adapted as 
follows. 
x Patients with GCS less than 15 at the 
time of assessment should have cervical 
spine imaging.
