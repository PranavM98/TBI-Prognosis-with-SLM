with secondary referral. While the cost 
of the primary transport to the DGH or 
to the NSH is similar, an inter-hospital 
transfer would be more costly than 
transport from the injury scene because 
it requires additional staff and tasks. In 
fact, an anaesthetist and a nurse would 
always accompany a patient who 
required urgent transfer, which 
constitutes 90% of the transfers for head 
injury. The GDG experts estimated the 
total cost of the transfer as equal to 
three-hour time of a nurse and an 
anaesthetist, given the time necessary to 
activate a secondary transfer team at 
the DGH, the time spent in stabilising the 
patient, and the actual transfer time. 
Moreover, on arrival at the NSH the 
patient would need other treatment for 
complications due to the transfer. With 
the average cost of a nurse at £19 per 
hour, and the cost of an anaesthetist 
(specialist registrar) of £34 per hour 204; 
the total cost per patient transferred 
was estimated to be £159.  
The cost of patient management at the 
Emergency Department in the two 
hospitals was not expected to be 
different, according to the GDG 
experts’ estimates, since the staff grades 
would not be different.  
All the cost figures are expressed in 
2006 Pound Sterling. Costs related to 
previous years were inflated using the 
Hospital and Community Health Services 
Prices Index 204. 
We have not calculated transportation 
and emergency department costs in 
much detail but would argue that this is 
not a major flaw since these costs are
