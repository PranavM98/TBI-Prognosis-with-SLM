patients on emergency department 
attendance. Patients and carers should 
also be alerted to the possibility that 
some patients may make a quick 
recovery, but go on to experience 
delayed complications. Instructions 
should be included on contacting 
community services in the event of 
delayed complications.  
Patients who presented to the 
emergency department with drug or 
alcohol intoxication and are now fit for 
discharge should receive information 
and advice on alcohol or drug misuse.  
These recommendations are based on 
level five evidence and are considered 
to be grade D recommendations. 
Suggested written advice cards for 
patients and carers are provided in 
Appendices E, F and G. 
8.9 
Discharge of patients with no carer at 
home 
All patients with any degree of head 
injury should only be transferred to 
their home if it is certain that there is 
somebody suitable at home to 
supervise the patient. Patients with no 
carer at home should only be 
discharged if suitable supervision 
arrangements have been organised, or 
when the risk of late complications is 
deemed negligible. 
This recommendation is based on level 
five evidence and is considered to be a 
grade D recommendation.
