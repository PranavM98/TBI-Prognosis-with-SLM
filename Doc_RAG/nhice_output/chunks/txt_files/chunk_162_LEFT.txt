predictions there was a more modest 
increase in CT and a more modest 
decrease in X-ray.   
The variation in impact between centres 
could be due to a number of factors 
including variation in the baseline 
position and completeness of adherence 
to the NICE guideline in the after period 
of the studies. In the centre that showed 
an increase in cost, X-rays were very 
low in number to start with and therefore 
there was less scope for cost savings; 
furthermore admissions had inexplicably 
increased slightly compared with the 
reductions seen at the other centres. The 
large amount of variation between 
centres means that the impact of our 
recommendations at a national level 
remains uncertain.
