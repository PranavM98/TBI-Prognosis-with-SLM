Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
a neurosciences centre bypassing the 
nearest hospital.  
Guidance will be required to define the 
patient population for example, 
researchers may focus on isolated 
injuries or head injuries associated with 
multi trauma. Further specification about 
what level of consciousness would be 
suitable for primary transfer to a 
neurosciences unit would be required. 
Researchers should look at the impact of 
the duration of transport on study 
outcome.  So for a journey time to the 
neurosciences unit of less than 20 
minutes, direct transport might improve 
outcomes, (as concluded by the London 
Severe Injury Working Group) but 
beyond this time, direct transport might 
worsen outcomes.

Advanced life support training for 
ambulance crews 
The value of advanced life support (ALS) 
training for ambulance crews over basic 
life support training (BLS) is 
controversial. ALS trained ambulance 
crews receive extra training in 
endotracheal intubation, intravenous 
cannulation, the administration of 
intravenous fluids and the use of 
selected drugs. A recent Cochrane 
systematic review concluded that 
insufficient evidence existed on the 
effectiveness of ALS training for 
ambulance crews.69 
Given this finding no change to current 
practice in ALS training for ambulance 
crews is recommended in these 
guidelines. This stance will be reviewed 
in forthcoming versions of these
