Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
view series has been quoted as between 
93-98%.94-96Sensitivity however varies 
from 62% to 84% in these high risk 
populations. It is estimated that in a high 
risk population one in six cervical spine 
injuries would be missed relying on an 
adequate three-view plain film series 
alone.97 If fractures that are clinically 
important are used as the gold standard 
then sensitivity is approximately 94%98 
and overall specificity 96% in a low risk 
group.99 
There is evidence that five-view cervical 
spine radiography does not improve 
predictive value compared to three-view 
radiography with CT as the gold 
standard.100 The use of a lateral view 
alone will miss a significant proportion 
of injuries detected by a three-view 
series.101 
Patients who have sustained major 
trauma are more difficult to evaluate 
with plain films and specificity decreases 
to between 79% and 89%, mainly due 
to inadequate or incomplete studies. The 
most common reason for this is poor 
visualisation of the cervico-dorsal 
junction.

Lateral flexion/extension views 
In alert symptomatic patients, lateral 
flexion/extension views can be safely 
performed over the pain-free range. 
Studies have shown significant false 
positive and false negative rates.102 Ten 
per cent of ‘normals’ may have 
‘abnormal’ flexion/extension views.103 
There is controversy over the safety of 
using fluoroscopically guided passive
