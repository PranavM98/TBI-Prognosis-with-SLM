was derived using recursive partitioning. 
The reference standard was CT scanning 
and clinical follow-up by a multi-modal 
method of patient monitoring. The 
CHALICE prediction rule had a sensitivity 
of 98.6% (95% CI, 96.4% to 99.6%) 
and a specificity of 86.9% (95% CI, 
86.5% to 87.4%). The CT scan ordering 
rate was 14%. This is a derivation study, 
not yet validated. 
The CHALICE Prediction Rule: 
A computed tomography scan is 
required if any of the following criteria 
are present.  
History  
x Witnessed loss of consciousness of 
more than 5 min duration 
x History of amnesia (either antegrade 
or retrograde) of more than 5 min 
duration 
x Abnormal drowsiness (defined as 
drowsiness in excess of that expected by 
the examining clinician) 
x 3 or more vomits after head injury (a 
vomit is defined as a single discrete 
episode of vomiting) 
x Suspicion of non-accidental injury 
(NAI, defined as any suspicion of NAI by 
the examining clinician) 
x Seizure after head injury in a patient 
who has no history of epilepsy
