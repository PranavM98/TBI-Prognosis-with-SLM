Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
sensitivity of 100% (95% CI, 97.2% to 
100%) and a specificity of 42.7% (95% 
CI, 40.5% to 44.9%) to identify 
traumatic brain injury requiring 
intervention. The prediction rule was 
used on the sub-group of patients that 
had a CT scan (n=1271) to identify 
traumatic brain injury identified on CT. 
The sensitivity was 99.0% (95% CI 
94.4% to 100%) and specificity 25.8% 
(95% CI 23.3% to 28.4%). This 
prediction rule missed one patient with a 
traumatic brain injury identified on CT. 
This is a derivation study, not yet 
validated.  
Palchak prediction rule: 
A CT scan is required if any of the 
following predictors are present: 
• Abnormal mental status 
• Clinical signs of skull fracture 
• History of vomiting 
• Scalp haematoma in children aged 2 
years or younger 
• Headache 
The final study by Dunning53 which is a 
prospective multi-centre cohort 
(diagnostic study level II evidence) 
reported 22,772 children (under 16 
years) presenting at ten hospital 
emergency departments in  the North 
West of England with any severity of 
head injury. Significant predictors of 
intracranial haemorrhage were 
determined and the Children’s Head 
Injury Algorithm to predict Important 
Clinical Events (CHALICE) prediction rule
