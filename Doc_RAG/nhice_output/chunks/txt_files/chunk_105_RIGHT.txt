CT imaging of the cervical spine 
CT imaging of the cervical spine may be 
localised (for example, craniocervical or 
cervico-dorsal to clarify a clinical or 
plain radiographic area of suspicion), or 
cover the whole cervical spine. Modern 
multislice helical CT scanners enable the 
whole cervical spine to be scanned at 
high resolution with ease.  Multiplanar 
reformatted images can be generated 
rapidly on modern workstations. Use of 
these modern facilities is increasing in 
the NHS, but total coverage has not yet 
been achieved. 
Several studies report 100% sensitivity 
for detection of injuries in areas poorly 
visualised or suspicious on plain films. 
These studies are flawed however in 
that they have not used an alternative 
gold standard.97 If CT imaging of the 
head has been requested the cost of 
cervical CT is reduced and can be 
accomplished quickly without patient 
transfer. 
6.6.1.4 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of 
the cervical spine 
There is evidence that MRI detects a 
higher proportion of soft tissue 
abnormalities when performed within 48 
hours of injury than plain film and CT104 
but the clinical significance of these 
injuries is unclear.  MRI is less effective 
than CT in the detection of bony 
injury.105 It has also been demonstrated 
that MRI can miss ligamentous injuries if 
delayed.106 Injuries of the mid-cervical 
spine, especially subluxation and lateral
