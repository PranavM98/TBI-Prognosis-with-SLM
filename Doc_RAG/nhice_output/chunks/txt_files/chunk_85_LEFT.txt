Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
away than the emergency department. 
There is also some confusion amongst 
hospital staff with regards to 
interhospital transfer of head injured 
patients. This is because patients who do 
not require surgery but do require 
neurosurgical care may remain in the 
district general hospital (DGH) and 
receive treatment there, when they 
actually require specialist treatment at a 
neuroscience unit. For interhospital 
transfers please see Chapter 7. 
An emergency department is described 
as a local, regional DGH with no 
neurosciences unit or a non specialist 
centre whereas a neurosciences unit is 
described as a specialist centre or a unit 
that has neurosurgical and 
neurointensive care facilities. 
The outcome measures for including 
studies for this review were mortality, 
neurological outcome, disability and 
hospital duration. Studies were excluded 
where; 
x data on head injury patients was not 
provided,  
x the patient group was less than 50% 
head injured patients, 
x  intervention was pre hospital care 
rather than transfer and  
x the outcomes reported only duration 
of transfer and no other outcomes.
