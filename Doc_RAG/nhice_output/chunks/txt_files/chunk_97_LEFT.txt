Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
rules contain a variable called 
‘dangerous mechanism’ (of injury), which 
is defined as a pedestrian struck by a 
motor vehicle, an occupant ejected from 
a motor vehicle or a fall from a height 
of greater than three feet or five stairs. 
The New Orleans rules did not consider 
this variable. The New Orleans rules 
contain a headache variable, which was 
dropped from the Canadian rules. 
The New Orleans rules contain a 
variable for drug or alcohol intoxication 
whereas this is not included in the 
Canadian rules. The Canadian authors 
seem to imply that having a variable 
"GCS less than 15 after 2 hours" will 
allow the less severe intoxications to 
resolve and eliminate a corresponding 
number of unnecessary scans. The 
Canadian authors measured ethanol 
levels in a sub-sample and found that it 
had no predictive power for the 
outcomes studied. 
UPDATE 2007: Adult rules 
Three new studies81,83,84 were retrieved 
for this review looking at clinical 
prediction rules in adults in addition to 
the studies in the previous guidleline (see 
section 6.5.2).  
One of the 3 new studies looking at 
clinical prediction rules in adults was 
Stiell et al81, a prospective cohort 
validation study (diagnostic study level I 
evidence) of 1822 blunt head trauma 
patients in nine Canadian emergency 
departments. In the previous guideline 
the derivation study was included. The 
inclusion criteria were defined as blunt 
trauma to the head resulting in witnessed
