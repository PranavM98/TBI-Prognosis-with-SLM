Discharge and Glasgow Coma Scale 
status 
3.8.1.1

emergency department or the 
observation ward should receive

patients and their carers. If necessary 
(for example, patients with literacy

languages other than English should 
also be facilitated. (D) 
3.8.2.2 
The risk factors outlined in the card 
should be the same as those used in 
the initial community setting to advise

also be alerted to the possibility that 
some patients may make a quick 
recovery, but go on to experience 
delayed complications. Instructions 
should be included on contacting
