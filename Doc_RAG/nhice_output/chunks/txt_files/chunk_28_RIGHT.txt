Summary of current care in the UK 
For 15 years, the UK followed 
guidelines for minor/mild head injuries 
based on consciousness level, with skull 
X-ray as the primary investigation, and 
admission for observation of most 
patients considered to be at risk for 
intracranial complications. CT scanning 
was generally reserved for patients with 
moderate or severe head injuries (GCS 
less than 13). CT scanning of patients 
who have sustained a head injury has 
gradually increased in recent years, 
since the first edition of the NICE 
guidelines for head injury.  However, 
there are still differences between the 
protocols being used in North America 
and the UK. 
 Only 1-3% of patients with head injury 
who are admitted to hospital in the UK 
for observation will go on to require 
neurosurgery, with the remainder being 
discharged. Even a small reduction in the 
proportion of patients requiring 
admission would have a substantial 
beneficial impact on hospital resources. 
There is evidence that outcomes for 
severely injured patients in England and 
Wales, as measured by severity 
adjusted odds of death, improved 
steadily up to the mid-1990s, but have 
not improved since. There is also indirect 
evidence that trauma care for patients 
with severe head injury in England and 
Wales is delivering a lower proportion 
of expected survivors when compared to 
trauma care in the United States, 
although these data are confounded by
