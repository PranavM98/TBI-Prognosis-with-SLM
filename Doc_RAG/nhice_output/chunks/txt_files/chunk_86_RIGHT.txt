definition of head injured patients. The 
other study66 showed that the mortality 
rate of immediate transfer to a 
neurosciences centre versus DGH were in 
favour of transport to a neuroscience 
centre. From this evidence review there 
is limited evidence for direct transport of 
head injured patients from the scene to 
a neurosciences unit being beneficial. 
A simulation model68 showed improved 
survival from directly transporting 
patients to a neurosciences hospital. 
However, a number of parameters were 
based on expert judgement rather than 
strong evidence.  A cost-effectiveness 
analysis based on this model showed 
that direct transport is likely to be costeffective.

Rationale behind recommendation 
There is no strong evidence to suggest a 
change in the previous recommendation 
(see bullet 5 within section 5.1). The 
GDG recognises that the transported 
patients with head injury directly to a 
neuroscience unit rather than a DGH 
would require a major shift of resources 
of between an additional 84,000 and 
105,000 bed days to neurosurgery from 
the existing general surgical, 
orthopaedic, emergency department, 
paediatric and geriatric services that 
currently care for these patients. The 
GDG recognize that further research is 
needed in this area in order to identify 
benefits in transporting patients with 
head injury to a neuroscience unit or a 
district general hospital. Therefore the 
GDG propose a research 
recommendation for this question (see 
section 5.5.7).
