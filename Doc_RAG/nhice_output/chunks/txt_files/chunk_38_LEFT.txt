Systematic review of indications for CT of 
the head 
This systematic review aimed to identify 
highly sensitive and specific clinical 
decision rules which could be used to 
select patients who are at high risk of 
clinically important brain injury, and who 
therefore should have CT imaging of the 
head. 
This search produced 1454 abstracts in 
MEDLINE and 680 abstracts in EMBASE 
(after duplicates with MEDLINE were 
excluded). An initial screen for relevance 
was carried out by one systematic 
reviewer, which reduced the number of 
abstracts to 174 in MEDLINE and 68 in 
EMBASE. These abstracts were then 
independently read by two reviewers to 
identify those papers that should be 
obtained and read in full. At this point 
the only criteria used was the likelihood 
that the paper described a rule for the 
diagnosis of intracranial haematoma 
(ICH), clinically important brain injury or 
need for a neurosurgical intervention in 
patients who have recently sustained a 
head injury, and produced some data 
on the likely sensitivity and specificity of 
the rule. Both derivation and validation 
papers were selected. 
The independent reviewing process 
produced 72 papers in MEDLINE and 20 
papers in EMBASE. In total 92 papers 
were deemed worthy of review.
