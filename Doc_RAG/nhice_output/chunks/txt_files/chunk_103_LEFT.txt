Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
to make sure that patients are 
transferred to a centre which does have 
the relevant equipment (see 
recommendation 6.5.6). 
UPDATE 2007: Child rules 
The original recommendation stated that 
validated adult rules (Canadian head 
CT rule) on imaging of the head may be 
safely used in children and infants. 
However, the GDG decided that a new 
recommendation was required for 
clinical prediction rules of the head in 
children with the emerging evidence in 
the Dunning study in this update 
(CHALICE)53.  
The CT ordering rates for both rules are 
similar53 and therefore the rule that is 
most accurate is likely to be the most 
cost-effective.   
 The GDG considers that the CHALICE 
rule for children is derived from the best 
current evidence for the treatment of 
head injuries in children, but the GDG 
cautions that this rule is a derivation 
study only and requires prospective 
validation. Therefore future 
recommendations will be dependent on 
future validation studies.

Recommendation 
For Adults - 
[Amended] Adult patients who have 
sustained a head injury and present 
with any one of the following risk 
factors should have CT scanning of the 
head requested immediately:
