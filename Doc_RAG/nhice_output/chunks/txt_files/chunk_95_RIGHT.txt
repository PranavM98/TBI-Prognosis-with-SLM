(that is, hospital attendees that had 
experienced some loss of consciousness 
or amnesia). 
It is also important to note that the 
Guideline Development Group is under 
the impression that head injury episodes 
are more likely to involve alcohol in the 
UK than in Canada, although exact data 
on this variable is not available. 
Both studies report 100% sensitivity 
(95% CI: 92-100) for need for 
neurosurgical intervention. The New 
Orleans criteria reports a 100% (95% 
CI: 95-100) sensitivity for positive CT 
scans, whereas the Canadian seven point 
rules are 98% (95% CI: 96-99) sensitive 
for detecting clinically important brain 
injury. The New Orleans rules have a 
25% (95% CI: 22-28) specificity for 
detecting positive CT scans whereas the 
Canadian rules are reported to have a 
50% (95% CI: 48-51) specificity rate 
for detecting clinically important brain 
injury. 
The New Orleans criteria would lead to 
a 78% CT ordering rate in patients with 
GCS equal to 15. The Canadian seven 
point rules would lead to a 54% 
ordering rate in patients with a GCS of 
13 to 15. It is important to note that the 
New Orleans study reports 100% CTscanning of the sample, whereas the 
Canadian study had a scanning rate of 
only 67%, and the remaining 33% had 
a proxy outcome assessment via 
telephone interview. The final sample in 
the Canadian study does not include 
some 10% of eligible patients who did 
not undergo CT and subsequently could 
not be contacted for follow-up.
