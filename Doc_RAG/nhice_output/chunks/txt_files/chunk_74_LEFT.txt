Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
identified that attempted to use a wide 
range of variables and tests to predict a 
range of longer term outcome measures, 
no robust clinical decision tool has 
successfully been derived and validated 
to identify patients at the time of injury 
who could be considered for follow-up 
due to a higher risk of long term 
sequelae. A systematic review of the 
literature would summarise and identify 
the optimal predictor variables for such 
a clinical decision rule and also identify 
the optimal outcome variables, thus 
laying the foundation for a derivation 
cohort study.  
The derivation cohort study to create this 
clinical decision rule could potentially be 
conducted in conjunction with the 
validation of the CHALICE rule, with 
follow up of patients involved in this 
study at 6mths-1yr. This would ensure 
optimal value for money for funders and 
ensure good results in a large cohort of 
patients. Separate studies could also be 
performed in adults but the initial study 
may in fact be more urgent in the 
childhood population.  
Identification of patients likely to suffer 
from long term sequelae will allow 
targeted research regarding 
responsiveness to, or effectiveness of 
focused rehabilitation programmes. 
Preventative action could potentially be 
taken, thus reducing the strain on 
resources further down the care 
pathway. Furthermore, patient outcomes 
could potentially be improved by early 
identification and treatment (both 
curative and preventive) of problems. 
However, further research is required 
before we can be certain that a robust
