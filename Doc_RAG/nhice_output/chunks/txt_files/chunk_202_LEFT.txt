Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
by ambulance crews at the incident site, 
after an 8-hour training course. Hence, 
training for ambulance staff in the 
assessment of head injury patients would 
be necessary to safeguard the 
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
the direct transport strategy. 
Since we do not have survival outcomes 
for the other simulation model based in 
London (see 11.6.2) we could not use it 
to estimate cost-effectiveness.  However, 
there is no reason to believe that it 
would effect our conclusions for near 
hospitals: if the specialist hospital is Â”20 
minutes from the injury scene then direct 
transport is likely to be cost-effective. 
For distances greater than 20 minutes, 
the authors of the London model have 
erred on the side of caution by not 
recommending bypass. It seems logical 
that the further away is the specialist 
hospital the more risky is direct 
transport. Given the uncertainty of the 
evidence in this area, if we are to 
recommend direct transport at all then it 
probably is better to use some kind of 
cut-off but it is unclear how the authors 
of the London model made this decision 
since analyses based on transport times 
longer than 20 minutes are not present 
in the report.   
The London model assumed that not just 
neurosciences but also other specialist 
services were available at the specialist 
centres. If specialist centres contain the 
whole range of services then the issue of 
whether ambulance crews can diagnose 
isolated head injury becomes less of an 
issue (this problem had been raised by 
several stakeholders), as long as 
specialist hospitals have adequate
