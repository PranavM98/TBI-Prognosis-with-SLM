1996-1998. This study examined 
patients who were transported to a 
regional/area trauma centre compared 
with patients transferred to non trauma 
centre. The patients in the latter group 
were assessed via the American Triage 
system (pre hospital care) and referred 
directly to a non trauma centre. The 
population were adults (over 13 years) 
with a GCS less than 14. Sub group 
data of 2763 head injured patients 
from a data set of 5419 trauma 
patients were analysed. Group 1 
(n=2272 (82.2%)) patients were 
transported to regional/area trauma 
centre. These patients were assessed via 
American Triage system (pre hospital 
care) and referred directly to the 
emergency department of either a 
regional or area trauma centre. Group 
2 (n=491 (17.8%)) patients were 
assessed via American Triage system 
(pre hospital care) and referred directly 
to a non trauma centre. The limitations of 
this study were that patients were 
categorised as head injured from data 
reported in trauma registry however the 
extent of head injury was unknown, 
because the GCS was classified as less 
than 14. The results of this study66 
showed that the mortality rate of 
immediate transfer to a neurosciences 
centre versus transfer to a non trauma 
centre were in favour of transfer to 
neuroscience centre with an odds ratio 
0.88, CI (0.64-1.22) which did not reach 
statistical significance. 
The second study67 (evidence level 2+) 
described a cohort of paediatric 
patients aged under 20 years old using 
a large national US paediatric trauma 
registry, admitted to one of ninety
