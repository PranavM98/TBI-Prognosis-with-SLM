Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
11.3.3 
Health outcomes (4 and 5, see Table 
11.2) 
A strategy that increases NHS costs 
would be economically justified if there 
were associated health gains. Intuitively, 
we might expect surgical outcomes to 
improve if intracranial haematomas 
(ICHs) are detected earlier. There is no 
direct evidence that a strategy of CT 
scanning can improve neurosurgical 
outcomes although there is some 
evidence that outcomes have been 
improved in patients with more serious 
head injuries.184 
UPDATE 2007: 
However, there is cohort study evidence 
suggesting reduced mortality associated 
with prompt surgery185,186. A paper 
retrieved during the 2007 update76 had 
estimated the quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) gained from prompt surgery by 
comparing the recovery and mortality 
rates in different case series (see 11.3.7 
below).   
Any health gains associated with 
detection could be partially offset by 
increased cancer risk. There is no direct 
evidence that exposure to medical Xrays does increase the incidence of 
cancer, however, there is a general 
association between radiation and 
genetic mutation and it is clear that the 
exposure level is considerably higher 
with CT scanning than with skull X-ray 
(see Chapter 10).

Other health service costs (6, see Table

The change in health outcomes just 
mentioned would lead to considerable
