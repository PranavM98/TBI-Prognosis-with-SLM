consciousness are currently transported 
to the nearest hospital by land 
ambulance or helicopter. The nearest 
hospital may not have the resources or 
expertise to provide definitive care for 
these patients. Patients should be 
followed as they pass through the care 
system with mortality and morbidity 
outcomes collected. These should be 
compared to allow, using sub-group 
analysis, the identification of patients for 
whom direct transfer is most beneficial. 
5.5.7.2 
Why this research is important 
Limited evidence in this area has shown 
that patients do better in terms of 
outcome if they are transported directly 
to a neurosciences centre when 
compared to those who are taken to the 
nearest DGH. This evidence however 
does not appear to have influenced 
current practice. For people working in 
the prehospital arena, it is important to 
define which patients who have 
sustained a head injury would do better 
by being transported directly to a 
neurosciences centre. 
Currently patients are either always 
transported to the nearest DGH as is the 
case in most land vehicle deployment or 
in some organisations especially those 
involving helicopter emergency medical 
services the decision is left to the 
judgement of the clinicians at the scene. 
Those patients transported to the nearest 
DGH may suffer a significant delay in 
receiving definitive treatment for their 
head injury. Information from such 
research can help to define which 
patients should be transported direct to
