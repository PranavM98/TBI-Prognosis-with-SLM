A wide spread of variables was 
identified which included; GCS/GOS or 
other measure of injury severity, S100B, 
Tau protein, Interleukin, other blood 
marker, other clinical data, cognitive 
measure, behavioural measure, 
disability measure, sensory measure, 
imaging measure, quality of life 
measure, social functioning, employment 
outcomes, length of stay, mortality, 
motor skills, demographics, psychosocial 
measure and somatosensory evoked 
potentials (SEPs) 
The population characteristics of age 
and injury severity were not reported in 
the majority of the reports. However, 
the most commonly studied populations 
appeared to be children (93 studies) 
and severely head injured patients (133 
studies).
