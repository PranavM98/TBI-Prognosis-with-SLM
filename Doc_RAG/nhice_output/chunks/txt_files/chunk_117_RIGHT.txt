[Amended] A clinician with expertise 
in non-accidental injuries in children 
should be involved in any suspected 
case of non-accidental injury in a 
child. Examinations/investigations that 
should be considered include: skull Xray as part of a skeletal survey, 
ophthalmoscopic examination for 
retinal haemorrhage, and examination 
for pallor, anaemia, and tense 
fontanelle or other suggestive features. 
Other imaging such as CT and MRI 
may be required to define injuries.  
This recommendation is based on level 
five evidence and is considered to be a 
grade D recommendation. 
Work on the derivation of clinical 
decision rules to predict non-accidental 
injury based on imaging patterns has 
recently been begun.127 However, the 
decision rules in this area will require 
substantial validation before they can 
inform clinical practice. Future versions of 
this guideline should determine the status 
of research in this area.

Good practice in emergency department 
assessment 
The following should be practised 
during emergency department 
assessment. 
- The priority for all emergency 
department patients is the stabilisation 
of airway, breathing and circulation 
(ABC) before attention to other injuries. 
- Depressed conscious level should be 
ascribed to intoxication only after a 
significant brain injury has been 
excluded.
