The literature reviewing process 
References identified by the systematic 
literature search were screened for 
appropriateness by title and abstract by 
an information scientist and systematic 
reviewer. The GDG also suggested 
further references and these were 
assessed in the same way.  
Selected studies were ordered and 
assessed in full by the NCC-AC team 
using agreed inclusion/ exclusion criteria 
specific to the guideline topic, and using 
NICE methodology quality assessment 
checklists appropriate to the study

contained within its guidance. This full 
version will only contain the 
recommendation grading for the original 
sections that have not been updated.

Research recommendations 
When areas were identified where 
there was a lack of evidence, the GDG 
considered making recommendations for 
future research. Decisions about inclusion 
were based on factors such as the 
importance to patients or the population, 
national priorities, and the potential 
impact on the NHS and future NICE 
guidance.
