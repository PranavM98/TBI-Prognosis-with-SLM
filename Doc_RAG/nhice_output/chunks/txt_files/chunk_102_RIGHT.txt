regarding the safety of adult rules with

UPDATE 2007: Adult rules 
Based on the three adult prediction rule 
studies81,83,84, the GDG decided that no 
change in recommendation was required 
as they felt there was not enough 
evidence to warrant a change. The case 
for selective CT scanning was 
strengthened by a cost-effectiveness 
model, although it was conducted from a 
US perspective and the UK evidence 
showed great variability between 
centres. One study had drawn attention 
to difficulties in scanning and 
discharging patients out of hours16, in 
particular, it is often not practical to 
discharge elderly patients during the 
night for social reasons. The GDG 
agreed that patients age 65 years or 
older presenting out of hours who are 
fully conscious and have no other 
indication for an immediate CT can be 
safely managed by admission for 
overnight observation without immediate 
CT. Admitting these patients overnight 
could be cheaper than out of hours CT 
scanning, especially as it would not be 
possible to discharge many of these 
patients. Furthermore the Af Geijerstam 
study showed that for head injured 
patients generally, observation was not 
associated with a significant increase in 
morbidity or mortality compared with 
immediate CT (see 6.4). The GDG also 
recognize that any centre which receives 
head injured patients should have 24 
hour CT scanner availability however 
there may be situations where due to 
failure of CT scanning equipment this 
may not be possible. It is then important
