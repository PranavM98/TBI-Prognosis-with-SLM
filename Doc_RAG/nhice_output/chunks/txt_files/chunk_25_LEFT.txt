specificity in the detection of 
haematomas was not determined.

Role of CT imaging 
An enhanced role for CT imaging after 
head injury was advocated by 
Neurosurgeons in 199015 and 199811, 
the 1999 guidelines from the Royal 
College of Surgeons of England and the 
2000 guidelines from the Scottish 
Intercollegiate Guidelines Network. 
These statements recommended a more 
liberal CT scanning policy, while still 
adhering to the skull X-ray as the first 
line investigation in the majority of 
minor/mild head injuries. 
This change in emphasis is reflected in an 
observed increase in CT scanning in the 
UK. Between 2002 and 2004 the 
number of CT brain scans requested in 
UK hospitals has more than doubled16. 
This move to CT reflects a general 
consensus that earlier definitive imaging 
is associated with improved 
outcomes.15,17

North American guidelines 
Prior to the first edition of the NICE head 
injury guidelines, the UK used level of 
consciousness and skull X-ray as primary 
assessment tools, coupled with 
observation for patients with 'mediumrisk' and CT for the highest risk groups. 
This translates to a CT scan rate of 
about 32% of all patients attending the 
emergency department with a head 
injury18-21. In contrast, rates of CT 
scanning in the USA at this time were 
between 75% to 100% of all patients 
with normal GCS and some previous loss 
of consciousness following a head 
injury.22
