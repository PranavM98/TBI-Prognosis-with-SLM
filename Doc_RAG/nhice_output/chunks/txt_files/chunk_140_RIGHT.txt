patients, with more senior supervision, 
fewer tests and shorter stays.157 There 
have also been concerns about the 
experience and skills of staff on general 
and orthopaedic acute wards in head 
injury care.12 This lead to a 
recommendation by the Royal College 
of Surgeons of England in 1999 that 
adult patients needing a period of 
observation should be admitted to a 
dedicated observation ward within or 
adjacent to an emergency department.12 
[Amended] In circumstances where a 
patient with a head injury requires 
hospital admission, it is recommended 
that the patient be admitted only under 
the care of a team led by a consultant 
who has been trained in the 
management of this condition during 
his/her higher specialist training. The 
consultant and his/her team should 
have competence (defined by local 
agreement with the neuroscience unit) 
in assessment, observation and 
indications for imaging (see 
recommendations 3.7); inpatient 
management; indications for transfer 
to a neuroscience unit (see 
recommendations 3.6); and hospital 
discharge and follow up (see 
recommendations 3.8).  
It is recommended that in-hospital 
observation of patients with a head 
injury should only be conducted by 
professionals competent in the 
assessment of head injury. 
These recommendations are based on 
level five evidence and are considered 
to be grade D recommendations.
