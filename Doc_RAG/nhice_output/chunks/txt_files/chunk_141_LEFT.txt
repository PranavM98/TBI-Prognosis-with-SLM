Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
The service configuration and training 
arrangements required to ensure this 
occurs are beyond the scope of these 
guidelines but it is hoped that this issue 
will be addressed by future NHS policy 
guidance.

Minimum documented observations 
For patients admitted for head injury 
observation the minimum acceptable 
documented neurological observations 
are: GCS; pupil size and reactivity; 
limb movements; respiratory rate; 
heart rate; blood pressure; 
temperature; blood oxygen saturation. 
This recommendation is based on level 
five evidence and is considered to be a 
grade D recommendation. 
9.5 
Frequency of observations 
As the risk of an intracranial 
complication is highest in the first 6 hours 
after a head injury, observations should 
have greatest frequency in this 
period.158 
Observations should be performed 
and recorded on a half-hourly basis 
until GCS equal to 15 has been 
achieved. The minimum frequency of 
observations for patients with GCS 
equal to 15 should be as follows, 
starting after the initial assessment in 
the emergency department: 
- half-hourly for 2 hours; 
- then 1-hourly for 4 hours; 
- then 2-hourly thereafter. 
Should a patient with GCS equal to 15 
deteriorate at any time after the initial
