Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
- Spontaneous hyperventilation 
causing PaCO2 < 4 kPa. 
- Irregular respirations. (D). 
3.6.1.9 
[Amended] Intubation and ventilation 
should be used before the start of the 
journey in the following 
circumstances: 
- Significantly deteriorating conscious 
level (one or more points on the motor 
score), even if not coma. 
- Unstable fractures of the facial 
skeleton. 
- Copious bleeding into mouth (for 
example, from skull base fracture). 
- Seizures. (D) 
3.6.1.10  [Amended] An intubated patient 
should be ventilated with muscle 
relaxation and appropriate shortacting sedation and analgesia. Aim for 
a PaO2 greater than 13 kPa, PaCO2 4.5 
to 5.0 kPa unless there is clinical or 
radiological evidence of raised 
intracranial pressure, in which case 
more aggressive hyperventilation is 
justified. If hyperventilation is used, 
the inspired oxygen concentration 
should be increased. The mean arterial 
pressure should be maintained at 80 
mmHg or more by infusion of fluid 
and vasopressors as indicated. In 
children, blood pressure should be 
maintained at a level appropriate for 
the childâ€™s age. (D) 
3.6.1.11 Education, training and audit are 
crucial to improving standards of 
transfer; appropriate time and funding 
for these activities should be provided.
