Clinical evidence  
In the 2003 guideline, a systematic 
review of clinical decision rules for 
selection of patients who sustained a 
head injury for imaging of the cervical 
spine was carried out according to the 
methods outlined in Chapter Two. Two 
level one studies were identified.52,122 
These were the NEXUS study group from 
America and the Canadian cervical 
spine rule. 
The remaining papers that were 
reviewed all contained non-level one 
evidence for a variety of rules and were 
derived in small cohorts. In addition 
some papers considered a variety of 
different aspects of cervical spine 
imaging. These included studies in 
patients who are not fully conscious, 
studies on the utility of flexion-extension 
views, studies in children and studies on 
the utility of CT scanning or MRI 
scanning. These studies are included in 
the evidence table but contribute little to 
the decision as to which rule to use to 
exclude low risk patients from cervical 
imaging. 
The Canadian cervical spine rule 
involves the following questions. 
x Is there any high risk factor present 
that mandates radiography: age 
greater than or equal to 65 years, 
dangerous mechanism, or paraesthesia 
in the extremities? 
x Is there a low risk factor present that 
allows the safe assessment of range of
