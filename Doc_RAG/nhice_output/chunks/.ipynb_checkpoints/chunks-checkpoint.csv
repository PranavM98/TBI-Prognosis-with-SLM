patients) are taking the experimental drug or a placebo (dummy treatment). The 
purpose of ‘blinding’ or ‘masking’ is to protect against bias. See also Double blind 
study, Single blind study, Triple blind study.  
C-spine 
Cervical spine or bony part of the neck 
Case-control study 
A study that starts with the identification of a group of individuals sharing the same 
characteristics (for example, people with a particular disease) and a suitable 
comparison (control) group (for example, people without the disease). All subjects 
are then assessed with respect to things that happened to them in the past, for 
example, things that might be related to getting the disease under investigation. 
Such studies are also called retrospective as they look back in time from the outcome 
to the possible causes.  
Case report (or 
case study) 
Detailed report on one patient (or case), usually covering the course of that person’s 
disease and their response to treatment.   
Case series 
Description of several cases of a given disease, usually covering the course of the 
disease and the response to treatment. There is no comparison (control) group of 
patients.  
Causal 
relationship 
Describes the relationship between two variables whenever it can be established 
that one causes the other. For example there is a causal relationship between a 
treatment and a disease if it can be shown that the treatment changes the course or 
outcome of the disease. Usually randomised controlled trials are needed to ascertain 
causality. Proving cause and effect is much more difficult than just showing an 
association between two variables. For example, if it happened that everyone who 
had eaten a particular food became sick, and everyone who avoided that food 
remained well, then the food would clearly be associated with the sickness. 
However, even if leftovers were found to be contaminated, it could not be proved 
that the food caused the sickness – unless all other possible causes (for example, 
environmental factors) had been ruled out. 
Cerebrospinal 
fluid  
(CSF) 
 
 
Clear fluid which is continuously being produced and absorbed by and in the brain, 
flowing in the ventricles (cavities) within the brain and around the surface of the 
brain and spinal cord 
 
CSF otorrhea 
Escape of CSF from the brain into the ear canal 
Cervical spine 
The cervical spine is the area of the vertebral column commonly refered to as the 
neck.  
The cervical spine is made up of seven vertebrae, refered to by 'C', appended with 
an identifying number. The number indicates the level of the spine in which the 
particular vertebra is located. The top vertebra is C1, the lowest C7 
 
Cervico-dorsal 
junction 
The junction between the bottom of the cervical spine and the top of the dorsal (or 
thoracic) spine. 
Clinical audit 
A systematic process for setting and monitoring standards of clinical care. Whereas 
‘guidelines’ define what the best clinical practice should be, ‘audit’ investigates 
whether best practice is being carried out. Clinical audit can be described as a 
cycle or spiral. Within the cycle there are stages that follow a systematic process of 
establishing best practice, measuring care against specific criteria, taking action to 
improve care, and monitoring to sustain improvement. The spiral suggests that as the 
process continues, each cycle aspires to a higher level of quality.  
Clinical decision 
rule 
A clinical decision rule/clinical prediction rule is generated by initially examining, 
and ultimately combining, a number of variables to predict the likelihood of a 
current diagnosis of a future event. Sometimes, if the likelihood is sufficiently high or 
low, the rule generates a suggested course of action1. 
Clinical 
effectiveness 
The extent to which a specific treatment or intervention, when used under usual or 
everyday conditions, has a beneficial effect on the course or outcome of disease 
compared to no treatment or other routine care. (Clinical trials that assess 
effectiveness are sometimes called management trials.) Clinical ‘effectiveness’ is not 
the same as efficacy. 
Clinical impact 
The effect that a guideline recommendation is likely to have on the treatment, or 
treatment outcomes, of the target population.",12,LEFT,680,Page 12 (LEFT)

Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
Clinical question 
This term is sometimes used in guideline development work to refer to the questions 
about treatment and care that are formulated in order to guide the search for 
research evidence. When a clinical question is formulated in a precise way, it is 
called a focused question. 
Clinical trial  
 
A research study conducted with patients which tests out a drug or other intervention 
to assess its effectiveness and safety. Each trial is designed to answer scientific 
questions and to find better ways to treat individuals with a specific disease. This 
general term encompasses controlled clinical trials and randomised controlled trials. 
Clinician 
A healthcare professional providing patient care, for example, doctor, nurse, 
physiotherapist.  
Closed head injury 
A blow to the head or a severe shaking causing  tearing, shearing or stretching of 
the nerves at the base of the brain, blood clots in or around the brain or oedema 
(swelling) of the brain. There is no penetration of the skull or brain tissue by an 
object; the skull may be fractured but this does not result in a direct connection 
between the brain and the outside. (see Penetrating Brain Injury) 
Cluster 
randomisation 
A study in which groups of individuals (for example, patients in a General 
Practitioner surgery or on a hospital ward) are randomly allocated to treatment 
groups. Take, for example, a smoking cessation study of two different interventions 
– leaflets and teaching sessions. Each General Practitioner surgery within the study 
would be randomly allocated to administer one of the two interventions. See also 
Cluster, Cluster design. 
Coagulopathy 
A condition affecting the blood's ability to form a clot. 
Cochrane 
Collaboration 
An international organisation in which people find, appraise and review specific 
types of studies called randomised controlled trials. The Cochrane Database of 
Systematic Reviews contains regularly updated reviews on a variety of health issues 
and is available electronically as part of the Cochrane Library.  
Cochrane Library 
The Cochrane Library consists of a regularly updated collection of evidence-based 
medicine databases including the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 
(reviews of randomised controlled trials prepared by the Cochrane Collaboration). 
The Cochrane Library is available on CD-ROM and the Internet. 
Cohort 
A group of people sharing some common characteristic (for example, patients with 
the same disease), followed up in a research study for a specified period of time. 
Cohort study 
An observational study that takes a group (cohort) of patients and follows their 
progress over time in order to measure outcomes such as disease or mortality rates 
and make comparisons according to the treatments or interventions that patients 
received. Thus within the study group, subgroups of patients are identified (from 
information collected about patients) and these groups are compared with respect 
to outcome, for example, comparing mortality between one group that received a 
specific treatment and one group which did not (or between two groups that 
received different levels of treatment). Cohorts can be assembled in the present 
and followed into the future (a ‘concurrent’ or ‘prospective’ cohort study) or 
identified from past records and followed forward from that time up to the present 
(a ‘historical’ or ‘retrospective’ cohort study). Because patients are not randomly 
allocated to subgroups, these subgroups may be quite different in their 
characteristics and some adjustment must be made when analysing the results to 
ensure that the comparison between groups is as fair as possible.  
Coma 
A sleep-like state in which a person is not conscious.  
Co-morbidity 
Co-existence of a disease or diseases in the people being studied in addition to the 
health problem that is the subject of the study. 
Community health 
services 
General Practice, ambulance crews, NHS walk-in centres and dental practitioners. 
Concussion 
The common result of a blow to the head or sudden deceleration usually causing an 
altered mental state, either temporary or prolonged. Physiological and/or 
anatomical disruption of connections between some nerve cells in the brain may 
occur. Often used by the public to refer to a brief loss of consciousness. 
Confidence 
interval 
A way of expressing certainty about the findings from a study or group of studies, 
using statistical techniques. A confidence interval describes a range of possible 
effects (of a treatment or intervention) that are consistent with the results of a study 
or group of studies. A wide confidence interval indicates a lack of certainty or 
precision about the true size of the clinical effect and is seen in studies with too few 
patients. Where confidence intervals are narrow they indicate more precise 
estimates of effects and a larger sample of patients studied. It is usual to interpret 
a ‘95%’ confidence interval as the range of effects within which we are 95%",13,LEFT,784,Page 13 (LEFT)

confident that the true effect lies.   
Confounder or 
confounding factor 
Something that influences a study and can contribute to misleading findings if it is 
not understood or appropriately dealt with. For example, if a group of people 
exercising regularly and a group of people who do not exercise have an important 
age difference then any difference found in outcomes about heart disease could 
well be due to one group being older than the other rather than due to the 
exercising. Age is the confounding factor here and the effect of exercising on heart 
disease cannot be assessed without adjusting for age differences in some way.  
Consciousness 
An alert cognitive state in which you are aware of yourself and your situation 
Consensus 
development 
conference 
A technique used for the purpose of reaching an agreement on a particular issue. It 
involves bringing together a group of about 10 people who are presented with 
evidence by various interest groups or experts who are not part of the decision 
making group. The group then retires to consider the questions in the light of the 
evidence presented and attempts to reach a consensus. See also Consensus methods. 
Consensus 
methods 
A variety of techniques that aim to reach an agreement on a particular issue. 
Formal consensus methods include Delphi and nominal group techniques, and 
consensus development conferences. In the development of clinical guidelines, 
consensus methods may be used where there is a lack of strong research evidence 
on a particular topic.  
Consistency 
The extent to which the conclusions of a collection of studies used to support a 
guideline recommendation are in agreement with each other. See also Homogeneity.
Control group 
A group of patients recruited into a study that receives no treatment, a treatment of 
known effect, or a placebo (dummy treatment) - in order to provide a comparison 
for a group receiving an experimental treatment, such as a new drug. 
Controlled clinical 
trial (CCT) 
A study testing a specific drug or other treatment involving two (or more) groups of 
patients with the same disease. One (the experimental group) receives the 
treatment that is being tested, and the other (the comparison or control group) 
receives an alternative treatment, a placebo (dummy treatment) or no treatment. 
The two groups are followed up to compare differences in outcomes to see how 
effective the experimental treatment was. A CCT where patients are randomly 
allocated to treatment and comparison groups is called a randomised controlled 
trial. 
Cost benefit 
analysis 
A type of economic evaluation where both costs and benefits of healthcare 
treatment are measured in the same monetary units. If benefits exceed costs, the 
evaluation would recommend providing the treatment.  
Cost effectiveness 
A type of economic evaluation that assesses the additional costs and benefits of 
doing something different. In cost effectiveness analysis, the costs and benefits of 
different treatments are compared. When a new treatment is compared with 
current care, its additional costs divided by its additional benefits is called the cost 
effectiveness ratio. Benefits are measured in natural units, for example, cost per 
additional heart attack prevented. 
Cost utility 
analysis 
A special form of cost effectiveness analysis where benefit is measured in quality 
adjusted life years. A treatment is assessed in terms of its ability to extend or 
improve the quality of life. 
Cranial 
Pertaining to the cranium. 
Craniocervical 
juntion 
The junction between the base of the skull and the top of the cervical spine. 
Crossover study 
design 
A study comparing two or more interventions in which the participants, upon 
completion of the course of one treatment, are switched to another. For example, 
for a comparison of treatments A and B, half the participants are randomly 
allocated to receive them in the order A, B and half to receive them in the order B, 
A. A problem with this study design is that the effects of the first treatment may 
carry over into the period when the second is given. Therefore a crossover study 
should include an adequate ‘wash-out’ period, which means allowing sufficient time 
between stopping one treatment and starting another so that the first treatment has 
time to wash out of the patient’s system. 
Cross-sectional 
study 
The observation of a defined set of people at a single point in time or time period 
– a snapshot. (This type of study contrasts with a longitudinal study which follows a 
set of people over a period of time.) 
Data set 
A list of required information relating to a specific disease. 
Decision analysis 
A systematic way of reaching decisions, based on evidence from research. This 
evidence is translated into probabilities, and then into diagrams or decision trees",14,LEFT,784,Page 14 (LEFT)

which direct the clinician through a succession of possible scenarios, actions and 
outcomes.  
Diagnostic study 
A study to assess the effectiveness of a test or measurement in terms of its ability to 
accurately detect or exclude a specific disease.  
Double blind study 
A study in which neither the subject (patient) nor the observer (investigator/clinician) 
is aware of which treatment or intervention the subject is receiving. The purpose of 
blinding is to protect against bias. 
Drowsiness 
A state of impaired awareness associated with a desire or inclination to sleep.  
Dura Mater  
The thick lining of the brain and spinal cord 
Economic 
evaluation 
Comparative analysis of alternative courses of action in terms of both their costs 
and consequences. 
Effectiveness 
See Clinical effectiveness. 
Efficacy 
The extent to which a specific treatment or intervention, under ideally controlled 
conditions (for example, in a laboratory), has a beneficial effect on the course or 
outcome of disease compared to no treatment or other routine care.  
Elective 
Name for clinical procedures that are regarded as advantageous to the patient but 
not urgent.  
Emergency 
Department (ED or 
A&E) 
A clinical department in a district general or teaching hospital which has trained 
staff and equipment able to receive, resuscitate, investigate and initially manage 
the full spectrum of emergencies. Most units accept patients of all ages, some are 
restricted to adults, others to children. All should be open at all times and all its 
facilities should be available at all times. 
Emergency 
Department 
Clinician 
A medically qualified member of an emergency department or an appropriately 
trained nurse working in an emergency department. 
Empirical 
Based directly on experience (observation or experiment) rather than on reasoning 
alone. 
Epidemiology 
Study of diseases within a population, covering the causes and means of    
prevention. 
European 
Paediatric Life 
Support course 
(EPLS) 
 The EPLS provider course is intended to provide training for multi-disciplinary 
healthcare professionals in the early recognition of the child in respiratory or 
circulatory failure and the development of the knowledge and core skills required 
to intervene to prevent further deterioration towards respiratory or 
cardiorespiratory arrest.  (see http://www.resus.org.uk) 
Event rate 
The proportion of patients in a group for whom a specified health event or outcome 
is observed. Thus, if out of 100 patients, the event is observed in 27, the event rate 
is 0.27 or 27%. Control Event Rate (CER) and Experimental Event Rate (EER) are the 
terms used in control and experimental groups of patients respectively. 
Evidence based 
clinical practice  
Evidence based clinical practice involves making decisions about the care of 
individual patients based on the best research evidence available rather than 
basing decisions on personal opinions or common practice (which may not always be 
evidence based). Evidence based clinical practice therefore involves integrating 
individual clinical expertise and patient preferences with the best available 
evidence from research 
Evidence table 
A table summarising the results of a collection of studies which, taken together, 
represent the evidence supporting a particular recommendation or series of 
recommendations in a guideline. 
Exclusion criteria 
See Selection criteria. 
Experimental 
study 
A research study designed to test if a treatment or intervention has an effect on the 
course or outcome of a condition or disease - where the conditions of testing are to 
some extent under the control of the investigator. Controlled clinical trial and 
randomised controlled trial are examples of experimental studies. 
Experimental 
treatment 
A treatment or intervention (for example, a new drug) being studied to see if it has 
an effect on the course or outcome of a condition or disease. 
External validity 
The degree to which the results of a study hold true in non-study situations, for 
example, in routine clinical practice. May also be referred to as the generalisability 
of study results to non-study patients or populations. 
Extradural (or 
epidural)

associated with a fracture of the skull. The underlying brain injury may not be 
severe initially but the increasing pressure caused by the bleeding inflicts further 
damage. 
Extradural space 
The space on the outer side of the dura mater.  
Extrapolation 
The application of research evidence based on studies of a specific population to 
another population with similar characteristics. 
Focal Neurological 
Deficit 
A neurological deficit restricted to a particular part of the body or a particular 
activity 
A graphical display of results from individual studies on a common scale, allowing 
visual comparison of results and examination of the degree of heterogeneity 
between studies. 
Forest plot 
Funnel plots are simple scatter plots on a graph. They show the treatment effects 
estimated from separate studies on the horizontal axis against a measure of sample 
size on the vertical axis. Publication bias may lead to asymmetry in funnel plots.  
Generalisability 
The extent to which the results of a study hold true for a population of patients 
beyond those who participated in the research. See also External validity. 
Glasgow Coma 
Scale 
Funnel plot 
A standardised system used to assess the degree of brain impairment and to 
identify the seriousness of injury in relation to outcome. The system involves three 
determinants: eye opening, verbal responses and motor response all of which are 
evaluated independently according to a numerical value that indicates the level of 
consciousness and degree of dysfunction. 
Gold standard 
A method, procedure or measurement that is widely accepted as being the best 
available. 
 
Haematoma 
An accumulation of blood in or under the tissues. 
Haemotympanum 
A collection of blood in the middle ear space 
Health economics  
 
A field of conventional economics which examines the benefits of healthcare 
interventions (for example, medicines) compared with their financial costs. 
Heterogeneity 
Or lack of homogeneity. The term is used in meta-analyses and systematic reviews 
when the results or estimates of effects of treatment from separate studies seem to 
be very different – in terms of the size of treatment effects or even to the extent 
that some indicate beneficial and others suggest adverse treatment effects. Such 
results may occur as a result of differences between studies in terms of the patient 
populations, outcome measures, definition of variables or duration of follow-up.  
Hierarchy of 
evidence 
An established hierarchy of study types, based on the degree of certainty that can 
be attributed to the conclusions that can be drawn from a well conducted study. 
Well-conducted randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are at the top of this hierarchy. 
(Several large statistically significant RCTs which are in agreement represent 
stronger evidence than say one small RCT.) Well-conducted studies of patients’ 
views and experiences would appear at a lower level in the hierarchy of evidence. 
Homogeneity 
This means that the results of studies included in a systematic review or meta analysis 
are similar and there is no evidence of heterogeneity. Results are usually regarded 
as homogeneous when differences between studies could reasonably be expected 
to occur by chance. See also Consistency. 
Hyperventilation 
Abnormally rapid breathing. Hyperventilation results in excessive intake of oxygen 
and increased elimination of carbon dioxide, which may eventually lead to a 
disturbance in the blood chemistry. 
Hypoglycaemia 
Abnormally low levels of glucose in the blood, leading to muscular weakness, 
confusion, sweating and, in severe cases, coma. Hypoglycaemia is a complication of 
many anti-diabetic treatments. 
Inclusion criteria 
See Selection criteria. 
Infant 
Aged under 1 year. 
Intention to treat 
analysis

alternative treatment. Intention-to-treat analyses are favoured in assessments of 
clinical effectiveness as they mirror the non-compliance and treatment changes that 
are likely to occur when the treatment is used in practice. 
Internal validity 
Refers to the integrity of the study design. 
Intervention 
Healthcare action intended to benefit the patient, for example, drug treatment, 
surgical procedure, psychological therapy, etc. 
Interventional 
procedure 
A procedure used for diagnosis or treatment that involves making a cut or hole in 
the patient’s body, entry into a body cavity or using electromagnetic radiation 
(including X-rays or lasers). The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence 
(NICE) has the task of producing guidance about whether specific interventional 
procedures are safe enough and work well enough for routine use.  
Intracranial 
Originating within the cranial (brain) cavity. 
Intracranial 
haematoma 
A collection of blood inside the cranium caused by damage to brain tissue or the 
rupture of a blood vessel. The resulting swelling can compress the brain. 
Intracerebral 
haemorrhage 
A bleed inside the brain tissue. 
Intracranial lesion 
A lesion of the brain.  
Literature review 
A process of collecting, reading and assessing the quality of published (and 
unpublished) articles on a given topic. 
Longitudinal study 
A study of the same group of people at more than one point in time. (This type of 
study contrasts with a cross sectional study which observes a defined set of people 
at a single point in time.) 
Mandible 
The lower jaw as a functional unit, regardless of which bones or cartilage make up 
the lower jaw in a particular organism. 
Meningism 
Stiffness of the neck associated with backwards extension of the cervical spine. 
Meta analysis 
Results from a collection of independent studies (investigating the same treatment) 
are pooled, using statistical techniques to synthesise their findings into a single 
estimate of a treatment effect. Where studies are not compatible for example, 
because of differences in the study populations or in the outcomes measured, it may 
be inappropriate or even misleading to statistically pool results in this way. See also 
Systematic review & Heterogeneity. 
Methodology 
The overall approach of a research project, for example, the study will be a 
randomised controlled trial, of 200 people, over one year.  
Methodological 
quality 
The extent to which a study has conformed to recognised good practice in the 
design and execution of its research methods.  
Monte Carlo 
simulation 
A modelling technique that uses random numbers to capture the effects of 
uncertainty. Multiple simulations are run (usually somewhere between 1,000 and 
10,000). For each simulation, the value of each uncertain variable in the analysis is 
selected at random from a probability distribution for the value of that variable. 
The simulation results are compiled, providing a probability distribution for the 
overall result. 
Motor response 
Movement in response to an external stimulus 
Multicentre study 
A study where subjects were selected from different locations or populations, for 
example, a co-operative study between different hospitals; an international 
collaboration involving patients from more than one country.

having been made to avoid problems of bias. 
Non-systematic 
review 
See Review. 
Objective measure 
A measurement that follows a standardised procedure which is less open to 
subjective interpretation by potentially biased observers and study participants. 
Observational 
study  
In research about diseases or treatments, this refers to a study in which nature is 
allowed to take its course. Changes or differences in one characteristic (for 
example, whether or not people received a specific treatment or intervention) are 
studied in relation to changes or differences in other(s) (for example, whether or not 
they died), without the intervention of the investigator. There is a greater risk of",17,LEFT,685,Page 17 (LEFT)

selection bias than in experimental studies.   
Occipital condyle  
The articulation point between the skull and the first cervical vertebra. 
Odds ratio 
Odds are a way of representing probability, especially familiar for betting. In 
recent years odds ratios have become widely used in reports of clinical studies. 
They provide an estimate (usually with a confidence interval) for the effect of a 
treatment. Odds are used to convey the idea of ‘risk’ and an odds ratio of 1 
between two treatment groups would imply that the risks of an adverse outcome 
were the same in each group. For rare events the odds ratio and the relative risk 
(which uses actual risks and not odds) will be very similar. See also Relative risk, Risk 
ratio.  
Outcome 
The end result of care and treatment and/ or rehabilitation. In other words, the 
change in health, functional ability, symptoms or situation of a person, which can be 
used to measure the effectiveness of care/ treatment/ rehabilitation. Researchers 
should decide what outcomes to measure before a study begins; outcomes are then 
assessed at the end of the study. 
Paediatric 
Pertaining to children and infants 
Paraesthesia 
Abnormal sensation such as burning or tingling due to a disorder of the sensory 
nervous system. 
Penetrating head 
injury 
Head injury where an object penetrates the scalp and skull and enters the brain or 
its lining. 
Performance bias 
Systematic differences in care provided apart from the intervention being 
evaluated. For example, if study participants know they are in the control group 
they may be more likely to use other forms of care; people who know they are in 
the experimental group may experience placebo effects, and care providers may 
treat patients differently according to what group they are in. Masking (blinding) of 
both the recipients and providers of care is used to protect against performance 
bias. 
Periorbital 
haemotoma 
Bleeding around or behind the eyes.  
Pilot study 
A small scale ‘test’ of the research instrument. For example, testing out (piloting) a 
new questionnaire with people who are similar to the population of the study, in 
order to highlight any problems or areas of concern, which can then be addressed 
before the full scale study begins. 
Placebo 
Placebos are fake or inactive treatments received by participants allocated to the 
control group in a clinical trial which are indistinguishable from the active treatments 
being given in the experimental group. They are used so that participants are 
ignorant of their treatment allocation in order to be able to quantify the effect of 
the experimental treatment over and above any placebo effect due to receiving 
care or attention.  
Placebo effect 
A beneficial (or adverse) effect produced by a placebo and not due to any 
property of the placebo itself.  
Positive predictive 
value 
The proportion of individuals with a positive test result 
who actually have the disease. 
Power 
See Statistical power. 
Primary care 
Healthcare delivered to patients outside hospitals. Primary care covers a range of 
services provided by General Practitioners, nurses and other healthcare 
professionals, dentists, pharmacists and opticians.  
Probability 
How likely an event is to occur, for example, how likely a treatment or intervention 
will alleviate a symptom. 
Prognostic factor 
Patient or disease characteristics, for example, age or co-morbidity, which influence 
the course of the disease under study. In a randomised trial to compare two 
treatments, chance imbalances in variables (prognostic factors) that influence patient 
outcome are possible, especially if the size of the study is fairly small. In terms of 
analysis these prognostic factors become confounding factors. See also Prognostic 
marker.  
Prognostic marker 
A prognostic factor used to assign patients to categories for a specified purpose – 
for example, for treatment, or as part of a clinical trial, according to the likely 
progression of the disease. For example, the purpose of randomisation in a clinical 
trial is to produce similar treatment groups with respect to important prognostic 
factors. This can often be achieved more efficiently if randomisation takes place 
within subgroups defined by the most important prognostic factors. Thus if age was 
very much related to patient outcome then separate randomisation schemes would",18,LEFT,694,Page 18 (LEFT)

be used for different age groups. This process is known as stratified random 
allocation.  
Prospective study 
A study in which people are entered into the research and then followed up over a 
period of time with future events recorded as they happen. This contrasts with 
studies that are retrospective.  
Publication bias 
Studies with statistically significant results are more likely to get published than 
those with non-significant results. Meta-analyses that are exclusively based on 
published literature may therefore produce biased results. This type of bias can be 
assessed by a funnel plot. 
P value 
If a study is done to compare two treatments then the P value is the probability of 
obtaining the results of that study, or something more extreme, if there really was 
no difference between treatments. (The assumption that there really is no difference 
between treatments is called the ‘null hypothesis’.) Suppose the P-value was 
P=0.03. What this means is that if there really was no difference between 
treatments then there would only be a 3% chance of getting the kind of results 
obtained. Since this chance seems quite low we should question the validity of the 
assumption that there really is no difference between treatments. We would 
conclude that there probably is a difference between treatments. By convention, 
where the value of P is below 0.05 (that is, less than 5%) the result is seen as 
statistically significant. Where the value of P is 0.001 or less, the result is seen as 
highly significant. P values just tell us whether an effect can be regarded as 
statistically significant or not. In no way do they relate to how big the effect might 
be, for which we need the confidence interval.  
Qualitative 
research 
Qualitative research is used to explore and understand people’s beliefs, 
experiences, attitudes, behaviour and interactions. It generates non-numerical data, 
for example, a patient’s description of their pain rather than a measure of pain. In 
healthcare, qualitative techniques have been commonly used in research 
documenting the experience of chronic illness and in studies about the functioning of 
organisations. Qualitative research techniques such as focus groups and in depth 
interviews have been used in one-off projects commissioned by guideline 
development groups to find out more about the views and experiences of patients 
and carers.  
Quality adjusted 
life years (QALYS) 
A measure of health outcome. QALYS are calculated by estimating the total lifeyears gained from a treatment and weighting each year with a quality of life 
score. 
Quantitative 
research 
Research that generates numerical data or data that can be converted into 
numbers, for example clinical trials or the national Census which counts people and 
households. 
Quasi 
experimental 
study 
A study designed to test if a treatment or intervention has an effect on the course or 
outcome of disease. It differs from a controlled clinical trial and a randomised 
controlled trial in that: 
a) the assignment of patients to treatment and comparison groups is not done 
randomly, or patients are not given equal probabilities of selection, or  b) the 
investigator does not have full control over the allocation and/or timing of the 
intervention, but nonetheless conducts the study as if it were an experiment, 
allocating subjects to treatment and comparison groups.  
Random allocation 
or Randomisation 
A method that uses the play of chance to assign participants to comparison groups 
in a research study, for example, by using a random numbers table or a computergenerated random sequence. Random allocation implies that each individual (or 
each unit in the case of cluster randomisation) being entered into a study has the 
same chance of receiving each of the possible interventions.  
Randomised 
controlled trial 
A study to test a specific drug or other treatment in which people are randomly 
assigned to two (or more) groups: one (the experimental group) receiving the 
treatment that is being tested, and the other (the comparison or control group) 
receiving an alternative treatment, a placebo (dummy treatment) or no treatment. 
The two groups are followed up to compare differences in outcomes to see how 
effective the experimental treatment was. (Through randomisation, the groups 
should be similar in all aspects apart from the treatment they receive during the 
study.)  
Rehabilitation 
A programme of clinical and vocational services with the goal of returning patients",19,LEFT,721,Page 19 (LEFT)

services 
to a satisfying occupation. 
Relative risk 
A summary measure which represents the ratio of the risk of a given event or 
outcome (for example, an adverse reaction to the drug being tested) in one group 
of subjects compared to another group. When the ‘risk’ of the event is the same in 
the two groups the relative risk is 1. In a study comparing two treatments, a relative 
risk of 2 would indicate that patients receiving one of the treatments had twice the 
risk of an undesirable outcome than those receiving the other treatment. Relative 
risk is sometimes used as a synonym for risk ratio .    
Reliability 
Reliability refers to a method of measurement that consistently gives the same 
results. For example someone who has a high score on one occasion tends to have a 
high score if measured on another occasion very soon afterwards. With physical 
assessments it is possible for different clinicians to make independent assessments in 
quick succession – and if their assessments tend to agree then the method of 
assessment is said to be reliable. 
Retrospective 
study 
A retrospective study deals with the present/ past and does not involve studying 
future events. This contrasts with studies that are prospective. 
Review 
Summary of the main points and trends in the research literature  
on a specified topic. A review is considered non-systematic unless an extensive 
literature search has been carried out to ensure that all aspects of the topic are 
covered and an objective appraisal made of the quality of the studies. 
Risk ratio 
Ratio of the risk of an undesirable event or outcome occurring in a group of patients 
receiving experimental treatment compared with a comparison (control) group. The 
term relative risk is sometimes used as a synonym of risk ratio.  
Sample 
A part of the study’s target population from which the subjects of the study will be 
recruited. If subjects are drawn in an unbiased way from a particular population, 
the results can be generalised from the sample to the population as a whole.     
Sampling 
Refers to the way participants are selected for inclusion in a study. 
Sampling frame 
A list or register of names which is used to recruit participants to a study. 
Secondary care 
Care provided in hospitals. 
Seizure 
An uncontrolled discharge of nerve impulses which may spread throughout the brain. 
It usually lasts only a few minutes. It may be associated with loss of consciousness or 
loss of bowel and bladder control. 
Selection bias 
Selection bias has occurred if: 
) 
the characteristics of the sample differ from those of the wider population from 
which the sample has been drawn  OR 
) 
there are systematic differences between comparison groups of patients in a 
study in terms of prognosis or responsiveness to treatment. 
Selection criteria 
Explicit standards used by guideline development groups to decide which studies 
should be included and excluded from consideration as potential sources of 
evidence. 
Semi-structured 
interview 
Structured interviews involve asking people pre-set questions. A semi-structured 
interview allows more flexibility than a structured interview. The interviewer asks a 
number of open-ended questions, following up areas of interest in response to the 
information given by the respondent. 
Sensitivity 
In diagnostic testing, it refers to the chance of having a positive test result given that 
you have the disease. 100% sensitivity means that all those with the disease will test 
positive, but this is not the same the other way around. A patient could have a 
positive test result but not have the disease – this is called a ‘false positive’. The 
sensitivity of a test is also related to its ‘negative predictive value’ (true negatives) – 
a test with a sensitivity of 100% means that all those who get a negative test result 
do not have the disease. To fully judge the accuracy of a test, its Specificity must 
also be considered.  
Sequelae 
Plural of sequela, which is any abnormal condition that occurs subsequent to and/or 
is caused by disease, injury, or treatment. 
Single blind study 
A study in which either the subject (patient/participant) or the observer 
(clinician/investigator) is not aware of which treatment or intervention the subject is 
receiving. 
Specific indication 
When a drug or a device has a specific remit to treat a specific condition and is not 
licensed for use in treating other conditions or diseases.  
Specificity 
In diagnostic testing, it refers to the chance of having a negative test result given 
that you do not have the disease. 100% specificity means that all those without the 
disease will test negative, but this is not the same the other way around. A patient",20,LEFT,780,Page 20 (LEFT)

could have a negative test result yet still have the disease – this is called a ‘false 
negative’. The specificity of a test is also related to its ‘positive predictive value’ 
(true positives) – a test with a specificity of 100% means that all those who get a 
positive test result definitely have the disease. To fully judge the accuracy of a test, 
its Sensitivity must also be considered.  
Standard deviation 
A measure of the spread, scatter or variability of a set of measurements. Usually 
used with the mean (average) to describe numerical data. 
Stand by call 
Contact between a paramedic or other healthcare worker and an emergency 
department, by telephone or radio, to alert the department to the impending 
arrival of a seriously ill or injured patient who will require immediate resuscitation. 
Statistical power 
The ability of a study to demonstrate an association or causal relationship between 
two variables, given that an association exists. For example, 80% power in a clinical 
trial means that the study has a 80% chance of ending up with a P value of less 
than 5% in a statistical test (that is, a statistically significant treatment effect) if 
there really was an important difference (for example, 10% versus 5% mortality) 
between treatments. If the statistical power of a study is low, the study results will 
be questionable (the study might have been too small to detect any differences). By 
convention, 80% is an acceptable level of power. See also P value.  
Structured 
interview 
A research technique where the interviewer controls the interview by adhering 
strictly to a questionnaire or interview schedule with pre-set questions. 
Study checklist 
A list of questions addressing the key aspects of the research methodology that must 
be in place if a study is to be accepted as valid. A different checklist is required for 
each study type. These checklists are used to ensure a degree of consistency in the 
way that studies are evaluated. 
Study population 
People who have been identified as the subjects of a study.  
Study quality 
See Methodological quality. 
Study type 
The kind of design used for a study. Randomised controlled trial, case-control study, 
cohort study are all examples of study types.  
Sub-group 
analysis 
An analysis in which the intervention effect is evaluated in a defined subset of the 
participants in the trial, or in complementary subsets, such as by sex or in age 
categories.  
Subdural space 
The space beneath the dura mater, between it and the much thinner arachnoid 
mater. This is often the area of rupture of delicate thin-walled veins following head 
injuries. 
Subdural 
haematoma (or 
haemorrhage) 
 
A collection of blood between the dura mater and the arachnoid mater caused by 
traumatic damage to the associated brain and blood vessels. The rise in pressure 
caused by such bleeding can cause further significant damage 
 
Subject 
A person who takes part in an experiment or research study. 
Subluxation 
A partial dislocation of a joint in which the joint surfaces remain in contact, albeit out 
of alignment. 
Survey 
A study in which information is systematically collected from people (usually from a 
sample within a defined population). 
Systematic 
Methodical, according to plan; not random. 
Systematic error 
Refers to the various errors or biases inherent in a study. See also Bias. 
Systematic review 
A review in which evidence from scientific studies has been identified, appraised 
and synthesised in a methodical way according to predetermined criteria. May or 
may not include a meta-analysis.  
Systemic 
Involving the whole body. 
Target population 
The people to whom guideline recommendations are intended to apply. 
Recommendations may be less valid if applied to a population with different 
characteristics from the participants in the research study – for example, in terms of 
age, disease state, social background.

Background and 
scope 
1.1 
Introduction 
This guideline was first published in June 
2003. The present guideline is a partial 
update of only some areas where new 
evidence has been published since the 
publication of the original guideline (see 
CG4 website 
http://guidance.nice.org.uk/cg41/niceg
uidance/word/English). This guideline 
incorporates both the original and the 
updated sections. All updated sections of 
the guideline are not shaded in grey to 
allow easy identification by the reader. 
All shaded sections have not been 
updated and is the original guideline. In 
this update, there are new 
recommendations in the sections on prehospital management, emergency 
department assessment, investigations 
for clinically important brain injuries, 
investigation for non-accidental injury in 
children, and transfer from secondary 
settings. These are highlighted in the 
document as ‘New’. A number of 
amendments have been made to other 
recommendations from the initial 
guideline, and these are highlighted in 
the document as ‘Amended’. Hospital 
Episode Statistics data for the 
2000/2001 annual dataset indicate 
that there were 112,978 admissions to 
hospitals in England with a primary 
diagnosis of head injury (ICD10 codes 
S00-S09). Seventy-two per cent of these",23,LEFT,198,Page 23 (LEFT)
chunk_23_RIGHT,"were male admissions and 30% were 
children under 15 years of age.2,3 
Extrapolating on the basis of relative 
population size gives an estimate of a 
further 6,700 head injury admissions in 
Wales. There are no reliable up to date 
figures for the total denominator of 
attenders with a head injury at 
emergency departments.  A figure of 
one million emergency department 
attenders for the United Kingdom as a 
whole is often quoted but this is based 
on figures from the late 1970s.4  It is 
estimated that head injury admissions 
represent around 20% of all head injury 
attenders,5 which would imply around 
600,000 patients per annum attending 
emergency departments in England and 
Wales with a head injury. The true 
emergency department attendance rate 
may be closer to 700,000 patients 
however, as it is likely that the 
proportion of patients with head injury 
admitted to hospital has fallen below 
20% in recent years. The poor quality of 
information regarding head injury 
attenders should improve as the use of a 
common emergency department dataset 
increases. 
The number of patients who undergo 
neurosurgery each year following a 
head injury is also unclear. A figure of 
around 4,000 patients per year for the",23,RIGHT,197,Page 23 (RIGHT)
chunk_24_LEFT,"31
 
Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
UK as a whole has been quoted6 but this 
may be slightly higher than is the case. 
Hospital Episode Statistics data for the 
2000/2001 annual dataset indicate 
that 398 patients in England underwent 
an operation to drain the extradural 
space (OPCS code A40) and 2,048 
patients underwent an operation to 
drain the subdural space (OPCS code 
A41)7.These figures do not include a 
small number of other neurosurgical 
procedures possible after head injury, 
and include some patients with a nonhead injury diagnosis. Thus, the routine 
data available does not allow for a 
precise estimate of neurosurgical volume 
after head injury for England and 
Wales, but points to a figure in the low 
thousands. 
Although the incidence of head injury is 
high, the incidence of death from head 
injury is low (6-10 per 100,000 
population per annum).5 As few as 0.2% 
of all patients attending emergency 
departments with a head injury will die 
as a result of this injury.7,8Ninety per 
cent of all people who have sustained a 
head injury will present with a minor or 
mild injury (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] 
greater than 12) but the majority of 
fatal outcomes will be in the moderate 
(GCS of 9 to 12) or severe (GCS less 
than or equal to 8) head injury groups 
which account for only 10% of 
attenders.9 Therefore emergency 
departments are required to see a large 
number of patients with a minor/mild 
head injury, and identify the very small 
number of these that will go on to have 
serious acute intracranial complications.",24,LEFT,270,Page 24 (LEFT)
chunk_24_RIGHT,"1.2 
UK Guidelines 
The first UK-wide guidelines on 
identifying patients who were at high 
risk of intracranial complications 
following a head injury were drawn up 
by a Working Party of Neurosurgeons in 
1984.10 They were used in the UK for 
over 15 years and relied on various 
clinical factors, particularly the level of 
consciousness, to place patients with a 
head injury into different risk categories. 
The main investigation incorporated into 
these guidelines was skull radiography, 
reflecting the importance of skull 
fracture as a risk factor for intracranial 
complications. Modifications to this 
guideline have since been published by 
the Society of British Neurological 
Surgeons in 1998, the Royal College of 
Surgeons of England in 1999 and by the 
Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines 
Network in 2000.11-13The assessment 
and imaging of patients who have 
sustained a head injury is also 
addressed by guidelines from the Royal 
College of Radiologists.14 
The recent recommendations of the 
Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines 
Network centre around the identification 
of patients with a high (for example, 
over 10%) risk of intracranial 
complications using the GCS, the 
presence of a skull fracture and various 
other clinical variables. These high-risk 
patients are recommended for computed 
tomography (CT) scanning. Admission for 
observation was considered a tool for 
patients with a 'medium-risk' of 
intracranial complications13 but the value 
of this in terms of sensitivity and",24,RIGHT,220,Page 24 (RIGHT)
chunk_25_LEFT,"32
 
Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
specificity in the detection of 
haematomas was not determined. 
1.3 
Role of CT imaging 
An enhanced role for CT imaging after 
head injury was advocated by 
Neurosurgeons in 199015 and 199811, 
the 1999 guidelines from the Royal 
College of Surgeons of England and the 
2000 guidelines from the Scottish 
Intercollegiate Guidelines Network. 
These statements recommended a more 
liberal CT scanning policy, while still 
adhering to the skull X-ray as the first 
line investigation in the majority of 
minor/mild head injuries. 
This change in emphasis is reflected in an 
observed increase in CT scanning in the 
UK. Between 2002 and 2004 the 
number of CT brain scans requested in 
UK hospitals has more than doubled16. 
This move to CT reflects a general 
consensus that earlier definitive imaging 
is associated with improved 
outcomes.15,17 
1.4 
North American guidelines 
Prior to the first edition of the NICE head 
injury guidelines, the UK used level of 
consciousness and skull X-ray as primary 
assessment tools, coupled with 
observation for patients with 'mediumrisk' and CT for the highest risk groups. 
This translates to a CT scan rate of 
about 32% of all patients attending the 
emergency department with a head 
injury18-21. In contrast, rates of CT 
scanning in the USA at this time were 
between 75% to 100% of all patients 
with normal GCS and some previous loss 
of consciousness following a head 
injury.22",25,LEFT,244,Page 25 (LEFT)
chunk_25_RIGHT,"In the UK, controversy over guidelines 
for head injury centres on whether 
increased CT scanning is feasible or 
advisable, but in the USA the discussion 
is exactly the reverse. Research in the 
USA is directed towards attempts to 
reduce the very large numbers of CT 
scans being performed.23-25 
1.5 
The skull radiograph 
Historically, in the absence of readily 
available CT scanning resources, skull Xray was used to categorise patients with 
minor/mild head injuries into high and 
low risk groups. Previously in the UK up 
to 74% of all patients attending 
emergency departments with a head 
injury received a skull X-ray,although 
only about 2% of these X-rays will show 
a fracture26,27. 
An elevation of risk following positive 
skull X-ray is widely acknowledged and 
supported by UK evidence.17 A recent 
meta-analysis of thirteen studies where 
at least 50% of the sample underwent 
CT was performed. The meta-analysis 
contained almost 13,000 patients who 
had recently sustained a head injury. A 
weighted mean prevalence of 
intracranial haemorrhage of 0.083 
(95% CI: 0.03-0.13) was observed. The 
meta-analysis found that the sensitivity 
and specificity of a skull X-ray for 
predicting the presence of intracranial 
haemorrhage were 38% and 95% 
respectively.23  The equivalent predictive 
values were 0.41 (positive predictive 
value) and 0.94 (negative predictive 
value). These figures imply that if there 
is a skull fracture diagnosed on 
radiography, the risk of an intracranial 
haemorrhage is elevated (about 4.9",25,RIGHT,231,Page 25 (RIGHT)
chunk_26_LEFT,"33
 
Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
times higher than before testing) but one 
cannot rule out an intracranial 
haemorrhage in patients for whom a 
skull X-ray does not show a skull 
fracture. 
One reason for the low sensitivity of 
skull X-ray in predicting an intracranial 
haemorrhage is the reliability of 
radiographic interpretation. It has been 
consistently shown that clinically 
competent emergency department 
clinicians will miss between 13% and 
23% of all skull fractures that are 
detected when radiographs are 
subsequently reviewed by a 
radiologist.20,27,28 
As CT scanning has both sensitivities and 
specificities approaching 100% for 
detecting and locating a surgically 
significant focal intracranial lesion, it has 
been established as the definitive 
diagnostic investigation in patients who 
have sustained a head injury. The 
relatively low ordering rate for CT in the 
UK has historically been a function of 
availability. However, there has been a 
substantial investment in CT scanners in 
England and Wales over the last 
decade, increasing the capacity of 
modern scanners within the NHS 
considerably. In addition, CT technology 
has advanced considerably in recent 
years (for example, multisection helical 
CT), reducing the duration of an 
examination, improving the imaging 
output and reducing radiation exposure. 
The new scanners have greatly reduced 
the need for general anaesthesia and 
reduced the sedation rate in infants and 
patients rendered combative by their 
injuries.29,30Nevertheless, anaesthesia",26,LEFT,232,Page 26 (LEFT)
chunk_26_RIGHT,"and ventilation may still be necessary in 
restless patients and young children.   
1.6 
Admission 
Acute head injury admissions account for 
320,900 bed days in hospitals in 
England (plus a further 19,000 in Wales 
by population extrapolation) 
representing 0.64% of all NHS bed 
days. 2,3This represents a significant 
resource burden on the NHS. However 
only 1-3% of admitted patients actually 
go on to develop life-threatening 
intracranial pathology, with the 
remainder going home within 48 hours, 
having had no intervention other than 
observation.7,8,20 
Also of concern is the quality of the 
observation that patients receive while in 
hospital. In a recent retrospective survey 
of 200,000 children in the North-East of 
England, only 14 children who presented 
with a minor head injury required 
neurosurgery. However, the recognition 
of secondary deterioration was delayed 
in all 14 patients, with documented 
routine neurological observations in only 
one child. Diagnosis of an intracranial 
haematoma was made between 6 hours 
and 14 days after the head injury, with 
a median delay of 18 hours.31 
This is not a problem unique to the UK. In 
the USA it has been found that only 
50% of patients admitted with a minor 
head injury had documentation of 
neurological observations and for the 
majority of these, the frequency of 
observations was not sufficient to detect 
early neurological deterioration.32 In the 
UK, patients with head injury have 
historically been observed on non-",26,RIGHT,229,Page 26 (RIGHT)
chunk_27_LEFT,"34
 
Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
specialist wards by nurses and doctors 
not experienced in neurological 
observation. In 1999 The Royal College 
of Surgeons of England surveyed 
General Surgeons in the UK and found 
that although 56% of Consultants 
observed patients with head injury on 
their wards, only 48% had any 
neurological experience and 34% were 
dissatisfied with this referral process. 
The Royal College advised that patients 
with head injury should not be observed 
in non-specialist wards,12 but it is unclear 
whether this has resulted in an increased 
proportion of patients with head injury 
being observed in appropriately staffed 
wards. 
1.7 
Morbidity 
The incidence of morbidity after head 
injury is higher than had been previously 
appreciated33 and far exceeds the 
capacity of UK neurorehabilitation 
services. In a study of head injury 
admissions in 1995/96 in Glasgow, 
47% of patients followed up for one 
year after discharge had survived with 
some form of restriction to lifestyle. 
Surprisingly, the proportion of patients 
experiencing the most serious sequelae 
(that is, moderate or severe), did not 
vary according to the severity of the 
initial injury. The study found that 47% 
of patients admitted with apparently 
minor/mild head injuries experienced 
significant sequelae on follow-up, 
compared to 45% of patients admitted 
for moderate head injury, and 48% of 
patients admitted for severe head 
injury. Only 47% of survivors with 
sequelae were seen in hospital after 
discharge and only 28% received some",27,LEFT,246,Page 27 (LEFT)
chunk_27_RIGHT,"input from rehabilitation services. A 
second large UK study examined the 
outcome of patients attending a minor 
head injury clinic34. They saw 639 
patients who had originally presented 
with a minor head injury. Fifty-six per 
cent were not back to work at 2 weeks, 
and 12% had not returned to work at 6 
weeks. In addition at 6 weeks many had 
persisting symptoms including headache 
(13%), memory loss (15%) and 
concentration problems (14%). These 
data have been reproduced in other 
countries.35,36 
1.8 
Cause of injury 
In the UK 70-88% of all people that 
sustain a head injury are male, 10-19% 
are aged greater than or equal to 65 
years and 40-50% are children. Falls 
(22-43%) and assaults (30-50%) are 
the most common cause of a minor head 
injury in the UK, followed by road traffic 
accidents (~25%). Alcohol may be 
involved in up to 65% of adult head 
injuries. Of note, road traffic accidents 
account for a far greater proportion of 
moderate to severe head injuries. Also 
there are marked regional variations, 
especially in assaults and the 
involvement of alcohol, but the incidence 
of penetrating head trauma remains 
low. The incidence of death due to head 
injury in the UK is 6-10 per 100,000 per 
annum.2-5,7 
In the USA 65-75% of people that 
sustain a head injury are male. The USA 
has a higher rate of road traffic 
accidents (~50%) and a lower rate of 
falls (20%-30%) than the UK, reflecting 
the difference in car usage in the two 
countries. Assaults account for around",27,RIGHT,254,Page 27 (RIGHT)
chunk_28_LEFT,"35
 
Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
20% of injuries although again there are 
regional differences. Alcohol is 
associated with around 50% of all adult 
head injuries: the alcohol may have been 
consumed by either the injured person or 
the person causing the incident. Firearm 
trauma to the head surpassed motor 
vehicles as the single largest cause of 
death from traumatic head injury in 
1990 in the USA. However, gunshot 
trauma to the head is not a common 
cause for attendance to hospital. This is 
largely due to the fact that 90% of 
gunshot wounds to the head are fatal 
and that two-thirds of people injured in 
this way will not reach hospital. The 
prevalence of death due to any 
traumatic head injury is 20 per 100,000 
in the USA, which is double the rate in 
the UK. Firearm-related deaths account 
for 8 per 100,000 of these 
deaths.19,22,37-40 
Comparisons with a Canadian 
population are important at this stage 
because of the importance of Canadian 
evidence to these guidelines. A large 
Canadian study on people with GCS 
greater than 12 following a head injury 
found that 31% of these people had 
sustained falls (comparable with UK 
estimates) and 43% had been in some 
form of road traffic accident (higher 
than the estimate of 25% for the UK). 
Assaults, by contrast, accounted for only 
11% of the Canadian sample, 
compared to estimates of 30-50% for 
the UK. The proportion of males in this 
study was similar to that observed in the 
UK (69%).25 The Guideline Development 
Group is of the opinion that a head 
injury episode is more likely to have",28,LEFT,279,Page 28 (LEFT)
chunk_28_RIGHT,"alcohol involvement in the UK than in 
Canada. 
1.9 
Summary of current care in the UK 
For 15 years, the UK followed 
guidelines for minor/mild head injuries 
based on consciousness level, with skull 
X-ray as the primary investigation, and 
admission for observation of most 
patients considered to be at risk for 
intracranial complications. CT scanning 
was generally reserved for patients with 
moderate or severe head injuries (GCS 
less than 13). CT scanning of patients 
who have sustained a head injury has 
gradually increased in recent years, 
since the first edition of the NICE 
guidelines for head injury.  However, 
there are still differences between the 
protocols being used in North America 
and the UK. 
 Only 1-3% of patients with head injury 
who are admitted to hospital in the UK 
for observation will go on to require 
neurosurgery, with the remainder being 
discharged. Even a small reduction in the 
proportion of patients requiring 
admission would have a substantial 
beneficial impact on hospital resources. 
There is evidence that outcomes for 
severely injured patients in England and 
Wales, as measured by severity 
adjusted odds of death, improved 
steadily up to the mid-1990s, but have 
not improved since. There is also indirect 
evidence that trauma care for patients 
with severe head injury in England and 
Wales is delivering a lower proportion 
of expected survivors when compared to 
trauma care in the United States, 
although these data are confounded by",28,RIGHT,234,Page 28 (RIGHT)
chunk_29_LEFT,"36
 
Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
case mix issues, especially the older age 
profile of patients with head injury in 
England and Wales.41 A sub-group 
analysis performed by the authors of 
this paper found that since 1989 there 
has been no improvement in the age 
and severity adjusted odds of death for 
patients with severe head injury in 
England and Wales (Lecky F, personal 
communication). 
The supply of emergency neurosurgical 
beds in the UK is limited. A recent survey 
revealed only 43 neurosurgical intensive 
care beds available for an overall 
estimated population of 63.6 million.42 
This shortfall can lead to delays in 
patient transfer, and is symptomatic of 
larger resource and workload issues for 
neurosurgery in the UK.43 These larger 
resource problems have many 
implications for head injury care, 
including delays obtaining a 
neurosurgical opinion at night or at the 
weekend. 
Finally there is increasing awareness of 
a high level of disability following 
minor/mild head injury. The provision of 
diagnostic and treatment services could 
bring great benefits to patients who 
would otherwise spend prolonged 
periods off work or dependent on 
others. Unfortunately, neurorehabilitation 
services in England and Wales do not 
have the capacity to provide the volume 
of services currently required. 
1.10 
Scope 
The National Institute for Health and 
Clinical Excellence (NICE) originally 
commissioned the National 
Collaborating Centre for Acute Care",29,LEFT,232,Page 29 (LEFT)
chunk_29_RIGHT,"(NCC-AC) to produce a clinical guideline 
for patients and clinicians on the early 
management of head injury, beginning 
in December 2001. The guideline 
published in June 2003. The guideline 
provided advice on effective care using 
the best possible research evidence. The 
guideline was based on a scope and 
commissioning brief received from NICE. 
These documents reflected a NICE 
consultation with relevant stakeholders. 
The clinical areas outlined in the scope 
were as follows: 
x pre-hospital management including 
assessment, airway management and 
ventilation, cervical spine protection 
and appropriate transfer; 
x indications for referral to hospital 
from pre-hospital care; 
x secondary care with the aim of early 
detection of intracranial complications, 
including admission for observation, 
skull X-ray and other imaging 
procedures, notably CT scanning and 
nuclear magnetic resonance; 
x criteria for transfer and discharge 
including circumstances when patients 
should be admitted to a neurosurgical 
unit, admitted for a short period of 
observation or discharged home; 
x criteria for surgical intervention; 
x information for patients and their 
carer/s prior to and during hospital 
admission; 
x management at home of patients who 
are discharged within 48 hours of 
admission including advice to primary",29,RIGHT,188,Page 29 (RIGHT)

care and emergency department staff 
on the management of patients who 
re-present with suspicious symptoms;. 
x guidance on appropriate handover 
arrangements; 
x information for patients and carers. 
1.11 
Population 
The guideline offered best practice for 
the care of all patients who presented 
with a suspected or confirmed traumatic 
head injury with or without other major 
trauma. Separate advice was provided 
for adults and children (including infants) 
where different practices were 
indicated. It offered advice on the 
management of patients with a 
suspected or confirmed head injury who 
may have been unaware that they had 
sustained a head injury because of 
intoxication or other causes.  The 
guideline did not provide advice on the 
management of patients with other 
traumatic injury to the head (for 
example, to the eye or face). It does not 
address the rehabilitation or long term 
care of patients with a head injury but 
the guideline does explore possible 
criteria for the early identification of 
patients who require rehabilitation. 
1.12 
Healthcare setting 
The guideline covers the care received 
from NHS advice sources (for example, 
NHS Direct, emergency department 
helplines), primary care, ambulance, and 
hospital staff who have direct contact 
with and make decisions concerning the 
care of patients who present with 
suspected or confirmed head injury. It 
recognises the need for care to be",30,LEFT,233,Page 30 (LEFT)
chunk_30_RIGHT,"integrated between the primary, 
secondary and tertiary sectors, and the 
need to ensure that none of these sectors 
is unnecessarily overburdened. It 
addresses the management of patients 
in primary care, pre-hospital, in 
emergency departments or similar units, 
and in the different hospital settings to 
which they may be transferred where 
observation for possible deterioration is 
indicated. 
The guideline does not address 
management within the intensive care or 
neurosurgical unit, but provides guidance 
on the appropriate circumstances in 
which to request a neurosurgical opinion. 
Service configuration, competencies, skill 
mix and training requirements of staff 
are outside the scope of the guidelines, 
as they are the remit of the NHS 
Modernisation Agency, but good 
practice points on these matters are 
introduced in places. 
1.13 
The need for this update guideline 
Up to 2 years after publication of all 
NICE guidelines any new evidence is 
considered for relevance and 
importance. The original guideline was 
produced in June 2003 and this current 
version is the 2 year partial update of 
the previous guideline. Since the Head 
Injury guideline was published there 
have been new studies with some 
changes in criteria with respect to CT 
scanning. This was identified as an area 
of concern at the time of the initial 
publication. In addition, a variety of 
comments have been received post 
publication on the following areas: 
guidance for CT scanning, issues relating",30,RIGHT,227,Page 30 (RIGHT)
chunk_31_LEFT,"38
 
Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
to the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), 
competencies and settings with particular 
respect to Emergency Department, Minor 
Injuries Unit and the community. There 
was sufficient new evidence to prompt 
an update. This update affects a few 
recommendations within the original 
guideline.  
New evidence has been incorporated 
using the latest version of the NICE 
technical manual (April 2007). The 
original guideline was produced using 
standard methodology between 200103 prior to the first version of the NICE 
technical manual. In this update we have 
not sought to revisit previously reviewed 
literature and recommendations except 
in the areas that we are updating. The 
write up of sections that we have not 
updated has not been amended and we 
have added sections only where an 
update was needed. A guideline review 
is carried out at 2 years and a proposal 
will be put forward to the Guidelines 
Executive at NICE based on this review. 
1.14 
What are clinical practice guidelines? 
NICE clinical guidelines are 
recommendations for the care of 
individuals in specific clinical conditions 
or circumstances within the NHS – from 
prevention and self-care though primary 
and secondary care to more specialised 
services. We base our clinical guidelines 
on the best available research evidence, 
with the aim of improving the quality of 
healthcare. We use predetermined and 
systematic methods to identify and 
evaluate the evidence relating to 
specific clinical questions.

1.15 The National Collaborating Centre for 
Acute Care 
This guideline was commissioned by 
NICE and developed by the National 
Collaborating Centre for Acute Care 
(NCC-AC). The centre is one of seven 
national collaborating centres funded by 
NICE and comprises a partnership",32,LEFT,188,Page 32 (LEFT)
chunk_32_RIGHT,"between a variety of academic, 
professional and patient-based 
organisations. As a multidisciplinary 
centre we draw upon the expertise of 
the healthcare professions and 
academics and ensure the involvement 
of patients in our work. Further 
information on the centre and our 
partner organisations can be found at 
our website.

1.16 
Remit of the Guideline 
The remit (Appendix A) was received 
from the Department of Health and the 
National Assembly for Wales in October 
2001 as part of NICE’s 2nd wave 
programme of work. This remit and 
scope have not been altered for this 
update. 
1.17 
What the update guideline covers 
The guideline covers best practice 
advice on the care of adults, children 
(aged 1-15 years) and infants (under 
one year) who present with a suspected 
or confirmed traumatic head injury with 
or without other major trauma. In certain 
circumstances, the age group ‘infants 
and young children’ (that is, those aged 
under 5 years) is used. Cut-off points of 
10 years and 12 years are also used. 
The guideline will offer advice on the 
management of patients with a 
suspected or confirmed head injury who 
may be unaware that they have 
sustained a head injury because of 
intoxication or other causes. The primary 
patient outcome of concern throughout 
the guideline is ‘clinically important brain 
or cervical spine injury'. For the purposes",32,RIGHT,221,Page 32 (RIGHT)
chunk_33_LEFT,"40
 
Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
of this guideline, clinically important 
brain or cervical spine injury is defined 
as any acute condition that has been 
identified by imaging or by assessment 
of risk factors. 
This update covers the following; 
x 
The benefits of transporting patients with 
head injuries to a neurosciences unit 
compared to an emergency department. 
x 
The benefits of secondary transfer of 
patients. 
x 
The best imaging tool for identifying 
patients with head and cervical spine 
injuries   
x 
The best clinical prediction rule for 
selecting patients with head and cervical 
spine injuries for the imaging tool 
selected.  
x 
Evidence on harm associated with 
radiation to the head and/or spine. 
x 
Identification of patients who should be 
referred to rehabilitation services 
following the initial management of a 
head injury 
Only 8 clinical questions (Appendix C) 
are covered within this partial update; 
all other criteria set in the scope 
(Appendix A) were adhered to in this 
update. This guideline incorporates both 
the original and the updated sections. 
All updated sections of the guideline are 
not shaded in grey to allow easy 
identification by the reader. Shaded 
sections have not been updated and are 
parts of the original guideline. All 
recommendations are in bold within each",33,LEFT,216,Page 33 (LEFT)
chunk_33_RIGHT,"section for reader ease, as well as a full 
list of recommendations at the beginning 
of the guideline. All recommendations 
are clearly stated whether they are 
‘new’ or ‘amended’ recommendations.  
1.18 
What the guideline does not cover 
The guideline does not provide advice 
on the management of patients with 
other traumatic injury to the head (for 
example, to the eye or face). The 
guideline will not address the 
rehabilitation or long term care of 
patients with a head injury but will 
provide criteria for the early 
identification of patients who would 
benefit from rehabilitation. 
Areas outside the inclusion criteria for 
each clinical question are not covered 
within this partial update. All criteria set 
in the scope (Appendix A) were 
adhered to in this update. 
1.19   Who developed this guideline? 
A multidisciplinary Guideline 
Development Group (GDG) comprising 
professional group members and 
consumer representatives of the main 
stakeholders developed this guideline 
(see section on Guideline Development 
Group Membership and 
acknowledgements). 
The National Institute for Health and 
Clinical Excellence (NICE) funds the 
National Collaborating Centre for Acute 
Care and thus supported the 
development of this guideline. The GDG 
was convened by the NCC-AC and 
chaired by Professor David Yates in 
accordance with guidance from NICE. A",33,RIGHT,203,Page 33 (RIGHT)
chunk_34_LEFT,"41
 
Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
few new members were involved in this 
update where the Chair and NCC felt 
those clinical specialties would be useful.  
The group met every 6-8 weeks during 
the development of the guideline. At the 
start of the guideline development 
process all GDG members declared 
interests including consultancies, fee-paid 
work, share-holdings, fellowships and 
support from the healthcare industry. At 
all subsequent GDG meetings, members 
declared arising conflicts of interest, 
which were also recorded (Appendix B). 
Members are either required to 
withdraw completely or for part of the 
discussion if their declared interest 
makes it appropriate, however this was 
not deemed necessary for any group 
members on this guideline. 
Staff from the NCC-AC provided 
methodological support and guidance 
for the development process. They 
undertook systematic searches, retrieval 
and appraisal of the evidence and 
drafted the guideline. The glossary to 
the guideline contains definitions of 
terms used by staff and the GDG.",34,LEFT,166,Page 34 (LEFT)

2 
Methods 
2.1 
Guideline development group 
A Guideline Development Group (GDG) 
representing all relevant professional 
and patient parties was formed in 
December 2001, under the 
Chairmanship of Professor David Yates 
from the Trauma Audit and Research 
Network.   
2.2 
Working principles 
It was decided by the GDG to focus the 
full systematic reviewing methods used in 
these guidelines on the selection of which 
patients who have sustained a head 
injury should be referred for imaging of 
the head and cervical spine, given that 
these issues are at the heart of acute 
management of head injuries. It was 
agreed that brief literature reviews and 
formal consensus methods would be used 
to deal with the remaining topics. 
For the purposes of the guidelines it was 
agreed that ‘infants’ are aged under 1 
year, ‘children’ are 1-15 year olds and 
‘adults’ are aged 16 years or more. In 
certain circumstances, the age group 
‘infants and young children’ (that is, 
aged under 5 years) is used. Cut-off 
points of 10 years and 12 years are 
also used where appropriate. ‘Head 
injury’ for the purposes of the guidelines 
is defined as any trauma to the head, 
other than superficial injuries to the face. 
It was also agreed that the primary 
patient outcome of concern throughout",35,LEFT,226,Page 35 (LEFT)
chunk_35_RIGHT,"the guideline development process 
would be defined as ‘clinically important 
brain injury'. It was agreed that need 
for neurosurgery was too limited a 
definition, given that operation is not 
appropriate for some patients and the 
guideline scope calls for some means for 
the early identification of those patients 
that might benefit from 
neurorehabilitation. This deliberately 
broad definition of outcome also reflects 
the heterogeneity of brain injuries that 
may be experienced following head 
trauma. 
2.3 
Systematic reviews 
The systematic reviews performed for 
these guidelines were designed to 
identify different types of clinical 
decision rule. The studies reviewed 
included derivation designs (usually 
cohort studies where the predictive 
power of a number of prognostic 
variables were explored) and validation 
designs (where the sensitivity and 
specificity of previously defined rules 
were examined).  Data collection may 
have been prospective or retrospective. 
The follow-up rate for important 
outcomes was also recorded: a standard 
of at least 80% follow-up is often stated 
for studies on the development of clinical 
decision rules. The use of multivariate 
statistics to identify the independent 
contribution of each variable to the rules",35,RIGHT,180,Page 35 (RIGHT)
chunk_36_LEFT,"43
 
Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
was also an important determinant of 
study quality. Systematic reviews of 
studies on the development of clinical 
decision studies and/or prognostic 
variables in head injury were also 
sought.   
The Guideline Development Group 
agreed to use classifications adapted 
from the Oxford Centre for Evidencebased Medicine Levels of Evidence (May 
2001), to summarise the evidence levels 
for reviewed studies. These differ from 
the levels of evidence normally used by 
NICE, as the NICE classification is not 
suitable for certain study designs. 
The levels of evidence used for studies 
on the development of clinical decision 
rules were as follows: 
1. Cohort study with consecutive patients 
and good reference standards, used to 
validate clinical decision rules; 
2. Cohort study with consecutive patients 
and good reference standards used to 
derive clinical decision rules (or 
validated on split samples only); 
3. Non-consecutive study or without 
consistently applied reference 
standards; 
4. Case-control study, poor or nonindependent reference standard; 
5. Expert opinion without explicit critical 
appraisal, or based on physiology, 
bench research or ""first principles"". 
The levels of evidence used for 
systematic reviews were as follows:",36,LEFT,195,Page 36 (LEFT)
chunk_36_RIGHT,"1. Systematic review (with homogeneity) 
of mostly Level 1 studies 
2. Systematic review (with homogeneity) 
of mostly Level 2 studies 
3. Systematic review (with homogeneity) 
of mostly Level 3 studies 
It was also agreed to adopt the Oxford 
Centre for Evidence-based Medicine 
classification for grade of 
recommendations (May 2001). This was 
used so that consistency with the levels of 
evidence classification could be 
achieved. 
The grades of recommendation used in 
this guideline are as follows: 
A. Consistent level 1 studies 
B. Consistent level 2 or 3 studies or 
extrapolations from level 1 studies 
C. Level 4 studies or extrapolations from 
level 2 or 3 studies 
D. Level 5 evidence or troublingly 
inconsistent or inconclusive studies of 
any level

radiation risks and CT of the head. 
2.5 
Consensus methods 
Formal consensus methods were used to 
generate agreement regarding the 
recommendations for these guidelines. 
Consensus was used for all grades of 
recommendation, even those based on 
level one evidence, to ensure complete 
‘sign-up’ by all GDG members to the 
final guidelines. An initial set of 
recommendations was circulated in 
questionnaire format, and GDG 
members rated their agreement with 
each recommendation on a nine point 
scale (strongly disagree to strongly 
agree). Separate ratings were made 
where relevant for infants, children and 
adults. A meeting was then held on July 
25th 2002 to discuss the 
recommendations in the light of GDG 
responses to the questionnaire. A revised 
set of recommendations was drawn up 
following the meeting and again 
circulated to GDG members for their 
appraisal. At this stage there was near 
complete agreement with all",37,RIGHT,204,Page 37 (RIGHT)

recommendations, and only minor 
revisions in wording were required. The 
recommendations presented in this 
guideline are the result of the consensus 
exercise. 
2.6 
Systematic review of indications for CT of 
the head 
This systematic review aimed to identify 
highly sensitive and specific clinical 
decision rules which could be used to 
select patients who are at high risk of 
clinically important brain injury, and who 
therefore should have CT imaging of the 
head. 
This search produced 1454 abstracts in 
MEDLINE and 680 abstracts in EMBASE 
(after duplicates with MEDLINE were 
excluded). An initial screen for relevance 
was carried out by one systematic 
reviewer, which reduced the number of 
abstracts to 174 in MEDLINE and 68 in 
EMBASE. These abstracts were then 
independently read by two reviewers to 
identify those papers that should be 
obtained and read in full. At this point 
the only criteria used was the likelihood 
that the paper described a rule for the 
diagnosis of intracranial haematoma 
(ICH), clinically important brain injury or 
need for a neurosurgical intervention in 
patients who have recently sustained a 
head injury, and produced some data 
on the likely sensitivity and specificity of 
the rule. Both derivation and validation 
papers were selected. 
The independent reviewing process 
produced 72 papers in MEDLINE and 20 
papers in EMBASE. In total 92 papers 
were deemed worthy of review.",38,LEFT,239,Page 38 (LEFT)
chunk_38_RIGHT,"A brief description of the rule proposed 
was extracted. Many papers do not 
provide explicit description of the 
diagnostic strategies, inclusion criteria, or 
post-diagnosis management strategies 
(for example, eligibility for early 
discharge).  The participant descriptions 
extracted were GCS levels, age, 
prevalence of important outcomes 
(especially intracranial haemorrhage) 
and the main inclusion and exclusion 
criteria. If a non-consecutive sample was 
described (for example, selection 
criteria was CT imaging where 100% CT 
imaging was not the rule being tested) 
this was noted. The outcomes extracted 
included the need for neurosurgery, ICH, 
intracranial injury and clinically 
important brain injury and CT ordering 
rate. Data on specificity and sensitivity 
were recorded where possible; 95% 
confidence intervals were also recorded 
or calculated if possible. 
2.7 
Systematic review of indications for 
imaging of the cervical spine 
The systematic review aimed to identify 
clinical decision rules which could be 
used to select patients who are at high 
risk of clinically important cervical spine 
fracture, and who therefore should have 
three-view plain radiography followed 
by other imaging if these prove 
inadequate. 
This search produced 863 abstracts in 
MEDLINE and 268 in EMBASE (after 
duplicates had been removed). An initial 
screen for relevance was carried out by 
one systematic reviewer, which reduced 
the number of abstracts to 142 papers 
in MEDLINE and 10 papers in EMBASE.

read in full. At this point the only criteria 
used was the likelihood that the paper 
described a rule for the diagnosis of 
cervical fracture, and produced some 
data on the likely sensitivity and 
specificity of the rule. Both derivation 
and validation papers were selected. 
The independent reviewing process 
produced 78 papers in MEDLINE and 7 
papers in EMBASE. In total 85 papers 
were deemed worthy of review. 
A brief description of the rule proposed 
was extracted. Many papers did not 
provide an explicit description of the 
diagnostic strategies, inclusion criteria, or 
post-diagnosis management strategies 
(for example, eligibility for early 
discharge). 
Participant details extracted included 
symptom status, alertness, age, number 
of centres, prevalence of important 
outcomes, the country of study and the 
main inclusion and exclusion criteria. The 
outcomes that the rule is intended to 
detect were noted. These included 
clinically important cervical fracture, 
unimportant cervical spine fracture, need 
for surgery and internal or external 
fixation. The radiography ordering rate 
was also noted as an outcome. Data on 
specificity and sensitivity were recorded 
where possible; 95% confidence 
intervals were also recorded or 
calculated if possible.",39,LEFT,215,Page 39 (LEFT)

Systematic review of means of identifying 
patients at high risk of late sequelae 
following head injury 
This systematic review aimed to identify 
clinical decision rules that could be used 
to select patients who are at high risk of 
late sequelae following head injury, and 
who therefore should be followed up so 
that potential long term problems can be 
identified. 
The original search for CT algorithms for 
the identification of prognostic variables 
for intracranial haematoma produced 
1454 abstracts in MEDLINE and 680 
abstracts in EMBASE (after duplicates 
with MEDLINE were excluded). This full 
abstract list was reviewed to look for 
papers that may be of relevance to 
disability. After this a search was 
performed on Medline and Embase, 
listed in Appendix 1 for prognosis of 
minor/mild head injury. Experts were 
also contacted for relevant papers. The 
search of the 1454 abstracts revealed 
152 potentially interesting papers. The 
additional MEDLINE and EMBASE search 
revealed 48 papers not previously seen 
of which eight abstracts looked to be of 
relevance. Experts provided three useful 
papers.  These abstracts were then 
independently read by two reviewers to 
identify those papers that should be 
obtained and read in full. At this point 
the only criteria used was the likelihood 
that the paper might describe a rule or 
provide factors in the acute assessment 
of the patient that might predict postconcussional syndrome. After this 
assessment 23 papers were selected for 
review",39,RIGHT,234,Page 39 (RIGHT)

A brief description of the rule proposed 
was extracted. Only one paper actually 
proposed a rule. Participant description 
focused on GCS levels, age, and the 
main inclusion and exclusion criteria. The 
outcome measures used were extracted. 
The definitions of long term disability or 
post-concussive were heterogeneous. 
Data on specificity and sensitivity were 
recorded where possible. As only one 
paper provided a rule, these figures 
could only be calculated for this one 
paper. The prevalence of important 
outcomes was also recorded. A previous 
systematic review was also available to 
the project team and this informed the 
review.

Systematic review of medical radiation 
This review aimed to provide simple 
estimates of the radiation risks 
associated with CT of the head. The 
search produced 654 abstracts in 
MEDLINE and 260 in EMBASE (after 
duplicates had been removed). A search 
using the Google search engine 
revealed useful documents from the 
United Nations Scientific Committee on 
the Effects of Atomic Radiation 
(UNSCEAR) and the National 
Radiological Protection Board (NRPB).  
Personal communications with the 
National Radiological Protection Board 
also provided papers and data which 
contributed to the review. Following 
abstract review and including the 
papers supplied by experts, 80 full 
articles were obtained and were 
reviewed to determine relevance. This 
identified 16 documents considered of",40,LEFT,227,Page 40 (LEFT)

Guideline update methodology 
The guideline update was commissioned 
by NICE and developed in accordance 
with the guideline development process 
outlined in 'The guidelines manual' 
updated in April 200645 and 200744. 
2.11 
Developing the clinical questions 
Clinical questions were developed to 
guide the literature searching process 
and to facilitate the development of 
recommendations by the GDG. The 
clinical questions were initially drafted 
by the review team and were refined 
and validated by the GDG. The 
questions were based on the scope 
(Appendix A). 
2.12 
Clinical literature search 
The aim of the literature search was to 
identify relevant evidence within the 
published literature, in order to answer 
the clinical questions identified. Searches 
of clinical databases were performed 
using generic and specific filters, 
relevant medical subject heading terms 
and free-text terms. Non-English studies 
and abstracts were not included. Each 
database was searched up to 8 January 
2007. Papers identified after this date 
were not routinely considered. Search 
strategies can be found in Appendix D. 
The following databases were included 
in the literature search to identify 
relevant journal articles: 
x Medline (Dialog Datastar) 19512006 
x Embase (Dialog Datastar) 1974-2006",40,RIGHT,196,Page 40 (RIGHT)

x NHS Economic Evaluation Database 
(NHSEED)  
Bibliographies of identified reports and 
guidelines were also checked to identify 
relevant literature. The internet was 
searched to identify guidelines and 
reports. The following web sites were 
used to help identify these:

Hierarchy of clinical evidence 
There are many different methods of 
ranking the evidence and there has been 
considerable debate about which system 
is best. The system used for the update 
was the one developed by the Scottish 
Intercollegiate Guidelines Network

The literature reviewing process 
References identified by the systematic 
literature search were screened for 
appropriateness by title and abstract by 
an information scientist and systematic 
reviewer. The GDG also suggested 
further references and these were 
assessed in the same way.  
Selected studies were ordered and 
assessed in full by the NCC-AC team

specific to the guideline topic, and using 
NICE methodology quality assessment 
checklists appropriate to the study

Grading of recommendations 
Following a public consultation in April 
2006 NICE is no longer publishing 
grades alongside recommendations 
contained within its guidance. This full 
version will only contain the 
recommendation grading for the original 
sections that have not been updated. 
2.17 
Research recommendations 
When areas were identified where 
there was a lack of evidence, the GDG 
considered making recommendations for 
future research. Decisions about inclusion 
were based on factors such as the 
importance to patients or the population, 
national priorities, and the potential 
impact on the NHS and future NICE 
guidance.",44,LEFT,191,Page 44 (LEFT)
chunk_44_RIGHT,"2.18 
Prioritisation of recommendations for 
implementation 
To assist users of the guideline in 
deciding the order in which to implement 
the recommendations, the GDG 
identified up to ten key priorities for 
implementation. The decision was made 
after discussion and voting by the GDG. 
They selected recommendations that 
would: 
x Have a high impact on patient 
outcomes, including mortality and 
morbidity 
x Have a high impact on reducing 
variation 
x Lead to a more efficient use of NHS 
resources 
x Mean patients reach critical points in 
the care pathways more quickly

Validation of the guideline 
Registered stakeholders were given the 
opportunity to comment on the draft 
guideline, which was posted on the NICE 
website. A Guideline Review Panel also 
reviewed the guideline and checked that

Summary of 
recommendations 
Below are the recommendations that the 
GDG selected as the key priorities for 
implementation followed by the full list 
of recommendations. 
3.1 
Key Priorities for Implementation 
3.1.1 
Initial assessment in the emergency 
department  
All patients presenting to an 
emergency department with a head 
injury should be assessed by a trained 
member of staff within a maximum of 
15 minutes of arrival at hospital. Part 
of this assessment should establish 
whether they are high risk or low risk 
for clinically important brain injury 
and/or cervical spine injury, using the 
guidance on patient selection and 
urgency for imaging (head and 
cervical spine). 
3.1.2 
Urgency of imaging 
[Amended] Computed tomography 
(CT) imaging of the head should be",45,LEFT,135,Page 45 (LEFT)
chunk_45_RIGHT,"performed (that is, imaging carried out 
and results analysed) within 1 hour of 
the request having been received by 
the radiology department in those 
patients where imaging is requested 
because of any of the risk factors: 
- GCS less than 13 on initial 
assessment in the emergency 
department. 
- GCS less than 15 at 2 hours after the 
injury. 
- Suspected open or depressed skull 
fracture. 
- Any sign of basal skull fracture 
(haemotympanum, ‘panda’ eyes, 
cerebrospinal fluid leakage from the 
ear or nose, Battle’s sign). 
- More than one episode of vomiting 
in adults; three or more episodes of 
vomiting in children.  
- Post-traumatic seizure. 
- Coagulopathy (history of bleeding, 
clotting disorder, current treatment 
with warfarin) providing that some 
loss of consciousness or amnesia has 
been experienced; patients receiving 
antiplatelet therapy may be at 
increased risk of intracranial bleeding, 
though this is currently unquantified –",45,RIGHT,146,Page 45 (RIGHT)

clinical judgement should be used to 
assess the need for an urgent scan in 
these patients.     
- Focal neurological deficit. 
[Amended] Patients who have any of 
the following risk factors: 
- Amnesia for events more than 30 
minutes before impact (the assessment 
of amnesia will not be possible in preverbal children and is unlikely to be 
possible in any child aged under 5 
years). 
- Age 65 years or older, providing 
that some loss of consciousness or 
amnesia has been experienced. 
- Dangerous mechanism of injury (a 
pedestrian struck by a motor vehicle, 
an occupant ejected from a motor 
vehicle or a fall from a height of 
greater than 1 metre or five stairs) 
providing that some loss of 
consciousness or amnesia has been 
experienced. 
and none of the following risk factors: 
- GCS less than 13 on initial 
assessment in the emergency 
department. 
- GCS less than 15 at 2 hours after the 
injury. 
- Suspected open or depressed skull 
fracture. 
- Any sign of basal skull fracture 
(haemotympanum, ‘panda’ eyes, 
cerebrospinal fluid leakage from the 
ear or nose, Battle’s sign).",46,LEFT,199,Page 46 (LEFT)

in adults; three or more episodes of 
vomiting in children.  
- Post-traumatic seizure. 
- Coagulopathy (history of bleeding, 
clotting disorder, current treatment 
with warfarin) providing that some 
loss of consciousness or amnesia has 
been experienced; patients receiving 
antiplatelet therapy may be at 
increased risk of intracranial bleeding, 
though this is currently unquantified – 
clinical judgement should be used to 
assess the need for an urgent scan in 
these patients.     
- Focal neurological deficit. 
should have CT imaging of the head 
performed within 8 hours of the injury 
(imaging should be performed 
immediately in these patients if they 
present 8 hours or more after their 
injury).",46,RIGHT,112,Page 46 (RIGHT)

Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
[New] Children under 10 years of age 
with a Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of 
8 or less should have CT imaging of 
the cervical spine within 1 hour of 
presentation or when they are 
sufficiently stable. 
[Amended] Imaging of the cervical 
spine should be performed within 1 
hour of a request having been 
received by the radiology department 
or when the patient is sufficiently 
stable. Where a request for urgent CT 
imaging of the head (that is, within 1 
hour) has also been received, the 
cervical spine imaging should be 
carried out simultaneously. 
3.1.3 
Admission 
[Amended] In circumstances where a 
patient with a head injury requires 
hospital admission, it is recommended 
that the patient be admitted only under 
the care of a team led by a consultant 
who has been trained in the 
management of this condition during 
his/her higher specialist training. The 
consultant and his/her team should 
have competence (defined by local 
agreement with the neuroscience unit) 
in assessment, observation and 
indications for imaging (see 
recommendations in 3.7); inpatient 
management; indications for transfer 
to a neuroscience unit (see 
recommendations in 3.6); and hospital 
discharge and follow-up (see 
recommendations in 3.8).",47,LEFT,208,Page 47 (LEFT)
chunk_47_RIGHT,"3.1.4 
Organisation of transfer of patients 
between referring hospital and 
neuroscience unit 
[Amended] Local guidelines on the 
transfer of patients with head injuries 
should be drawn up between the 
referring hospital trusts, the 
neuroscience unit and the local 
ambulance service, and should 
recognise that: 
- transfer would benefit all patients 
with serious head injuries (GCS  8), 
irrespective of the need for 
neurosurgery 
- if transfer of those who do not 
require neurosurgery is not possible, 
ongoing liaison with the neuroscience 
unit over clinical management is 
essential.  
3.1.5 
Advice about long-term problems and 
support services  
[Amended] All patients and their 
carers should be made aware of the 
possibility of long-term symptoms and 
disabilities following head injury and 
should be made aware of the 
existence of services that they could 
contact should they experience longterm problems. Details of support 
services should be included on patient 
discharge advice cards. 
3.2 
The complete list of clinical practice 
recommendations 
3.2.1 
Glasgow Coma Scale 
The assessment and classification of 
patients who have sustained a head 
injury should be guided primarily by the 
adult and paediatric versions of the",47,RIGHT,183,Page 47 (RIGHT)
chunk_48_LEFT,"55
 
Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
Glasgow Coma Scale and its derivative 
the Glasgow Coma Score (GCS). 
Recommended versions are shown in 
Appendix M and Appendix N. Good 
practice in the use of the Glasgow Coma 
Scale and Score should be adhered to 
at all times, following the principles 
below. 
3.2.1.1 
Monitoring and exchange of 
information about individual patients 
should be based on the three separate 
responses on the Glasgow Coma Score 
(for example, a patient scoring 13 
based on scores of 4 on eye-opening, 
4 on verbal response and 5 on motor 
response should be communicated as 
E4, V4, M5). (D) 
3.2.1.2 
If a total score is recorded or 
communicated, it should be based on 
a sum of 15, and to avoid confusion 
this denominator should be specified 
(for example, 13/15). (D) 
3.2.1.3 
The individual components of the GCS 
should be described in all 
communications and every note and 
should always accompany the total 
score. (D) 
3.2.1.4 
The paediatric version of the Glasgow 
Coma Score should include a ‘grimace’ 
alternative to the verbal score to 
facilitate scoring in pre-verbal or 
intubated patients.  (D) 
3.2.1.5 
Best practice in paediatric coma 
observation and recording as detailed 
by the National Paediatric 
Neuroscience Benchmarking Group 
should be followed at all times. (these 
principles are detailed in Appendix N).",48,LEFT,226,Page 48 (LEFT)
chunk_48_RIGHT,"3.2.2 
Public health literature 
3.2.2.1 
Public health literature and other nonmedical sources of advice (for 
example, St John Ambulance, police 
officers) should encourage people who 
have any concerns following a head 
injury to themselves or to another 
person, regardless of the injury 
severity, to seek immediate medical 
advice. (D) 
3.2.3 
Training in risk assessment 
3.2.3.1 
[Amended] It is recommended that 
General Practitioners, nurses, dentists 
and ambulance crews should receive 
training, as necessary, to ensure that 
they are capable of assessing the 
presence or absence of the risk factors 
listed in recommendations 3.3.2.  (D) 
3.2.4 
Support for familes and carers 
3.2.4.1 
There should be a protocol for all staff 
to introduce themselves to family 
members or carers and briefly explain 
what they are doing. In addition a 
photographic board with the names 
and titles of personnel in the hospital 
departments caring for patients with 
head injury can be helpful. (D) 
3.2.4.2 
Information sheets detailing the nature 
of head injury and any investigations 
likely to be used should be available 
in the emergency department. The 
patient version of these NICE 
guidelines may be helpful. (D) 
3.2.4.3 
Staff should consider how best to 
share information with children and 
introduce them to the possibility of 
long term complex changes in their 
parent or sibling. Literature produced",48,RIGHT,212,Page 48 (RIGHT)

Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
by patient support groups may be 
helpful. (D) 
3.2.4.4 
[Amended] Healthcare professionals 
should encourage carers and relatives 
to talk and make physical contact (for 
example, holding hands) with the 
patient. However, it is important that 
relatives and friends do not feel 
obliged to spend long peiods at the 
bedside. If they wish to stay with the 
patient, they should be encouraged to 
take regular breaks. (D) 
3.2.4.5 
There should be a board or area 
displaying leaflets or contact details 
for patient support organisations either 
locally or nationally to enable family 
members to gather further information. 
3.3 
Presentation and referral 
A person with a head injury may 
present via a telephone advice service 
or to a community health service or 
minor injury clinic. The following 
recommendations apply in these 
settings.  
3.3.1 
Telephone advice lines 
3.3.1.1 
[Amended] Telephone advice services 
(for example, NHS Direct, emergency 
department helplines) should refer 
people who have sustained a head 
injury to the emergency ambulance 
services (that is, 999) for emergency 
transport to the emergency department 
if they have experienced any of the 
following (alternative terms to 
facilitate communication are in 
parenthesis):",49,LEFT,202,Page 49 (LEFT)
chunk_49_RIGHT,"- Unconsciousness, or lack of full 
consciousness (for example, problems 
keeping eyes open). 
- Any focal (that is, restricted to a 
particular part of the body or a 
particular activity) neurological deficit 
since the injury (examples include 
problems understanding, speaking, 
reading or writing; loss of feeling in 
part of the body; problems balancing; 
general weakness; any changes in 
eyesight; and problems walking). 
- Any suspicion of a skull fracture or 
penetrating head injury (for example, 
clear fluid running from the ears or 
nose, black eye with no associated 
damage around the eye, bleeding from 
one or both ears, new deafness in one 
or both ears, bruising behind one or 
both ears, penetrating injury signs, 
visible trauma to the scalp or skull). 
- Any seizure (‘convulsion’ or ‘fit’) 
since the injury. 
- A high-energy head injury (for 
example, pedestrian struck by motor 
vehicle, occupant ejected from motor 
vehicle, a fall from a height of greater 
than 1 metre or more than five stairs, 
diving accident, high-speed motor 
vehicle collision, rollover motor 
accident, accident involving motorized 
recreational vehicles, bicycle collision, 
or any other potentially high-energy 
mechanism).  
- The injured person or their carer is 
incapable of transporting the injured 
person safely to the hospital 
emergency department without the use",49,RIGHT,207,Page 49 (RIGHT)

of ambulance services (providing any 
other risk factor indicating emergency 
department referral is present). (D) 
3.3.1.2 
Telephone advice services (for 
example, NHS Direct, emergency 
department helplines) should refer 
people who have sustained a head 
injury to a hospital emergency 
department if the history related 
indicates the presence of any of the 
following risk factors (alternative 
terms to facilitate communication are 
in parenthesis): 
- Any previous loss of consciousness 
(‘knocked out’) as a result of the 
injury, from which the injured person 
has now recovered. 
- Amnesia for events before or after 
the injury (‘problems with memory’). 
The assessment of amnesia will not be 
possible in pre-verbal children and is 
unlikely to be possible in any child 
aged under 5 years. 
- Persistent headache since the injury. 
- Any vomiting episodes since the 
injury. 
- Any previous cranial neurosurgical 
interventions (‘brain surgery’). 
- History of bleeding or clotting 
disorder. 
- Current anticoagulant therapy such 
as warfarin. 
- Current drug or alcohol intoxication. 
- Age 65 years or older.",50,LEFT,184,Page 50 (LEFT)
chunk_50_RIGHT,"- Suspicion of non-accidental injury. 
- Irritability or altered behaviour 
(‘easily distracted’ ‘not themselves’ ‘no 
concentration’ ‘no interest in things 
around them’) particularly in infants 
and young children (that is, aged 
under 5 years). 
- Continuing concern by the helpline 
personnel about the diagnosis. (D) 
3.3.1.3 
In the absence of any of the factors 
listed in 3.3.1.1 and 3.3.1.2, the 
helpline should advise the injured 
person to seek medical advice from 
community services (for example, 
general practice) if any of the 
following factors are present: 
- Adverse social factors (for example, 
no-one able to supervise the injured 
person at home). 
Continuing concern by the injured 
person or their carer about the 
diagnosis. (D) 
3.3.2 
Community health services and NHS 
minor injury clinics 
3.3.2.1 
[Amended] Community health services 
(general practice, ambulance crews, 
NHS walk-in centres, dental 
practitioners) and NHS minor injury 
clinics should refer patients who have 
sustained a head injury to a hospital 
emergency department, using the 
ambulance service if deemed 
necessary (see section 3.4.1.1); if any

Transport to the emergency department 
3.4.1.1 
Patients referred from community 
health services and NHS minor injury 
clinics should be accompanied by a 
competent adult during transport to the 
emergency department. (D) 
3.4.1.2 
The referring professional should 
determine if an ambulance is required, 
based on the patient's clinical 
condition. If an ambulance is deemed 
not required, public transport and car 
are appropriate means of transport 
providing the patient is accompanied. 
3.4.1.3 
The referring professional should 
inform the destination hospital (by 
phone) of the impending transfer and 
in non-emergencies a letter 
summarising signs and symptoms

Pre-hospital management 
The following principles should be 
adhered to in the immediate care of 
patients who have sustained a head 
injury. 
3.4.2.1 
[Amended] Adults who have 
sustained a head injury should 
initially be assessed and their care 
managed according to clear principles 
and standard practice, as embodied in: 
the Advanced Trauma Life Support 
(ATLS) course/European Trauma 
course; the International Trauma Life 
Support (ITLS) course; the Pre-hospital 
Trauma Life Support (PHTLS) course;",52,LEFT,204,Page 52 (LEFT)

(ATNC); the Trauma Nursing Core 
Course (TNCC); and the Joint Royal 
Colleges Ambulance Service Liaison 
Committee (JRCALC) Clinical Practice 
Guidelines for Head Trauma. For 
children, clear principles are outlined 
in the Advanced Paediatric Life 
Support (APLS)/European Paediatric 
Life Support (EPLS) course, the Prehospital Paediatric Life Support 
(PHPLS) course and the Paediatric 
Education for Pre-hospital 
Professionals (PEPP) course. (D)   
3.4.2.2 
Ambulance crews should be fully 
trained in the use of the adult and 
paediatric versions of the Glasgow 
Coma Scale. (D) 
3.4.2.3 
Ambulance crews should be trained in 
the detection of non-accidental injury 
and should pass information to 
emergency department personnel 
when the relevant signs and 
symptoms arise. (D) 
3.4.2.4 
The priority for those administering 
immediate care is to treat first the 
greatest threat to life and avoid further 
harm. (D) 
3.4.2.5 
[Amended] Patients who have 
sustained a head injury should be 
transported directly to a facility that 
has been identified as having the 
resources necessary to resuscitate, 
investigate and initially manage any 
patient with multiple injuries. It is 
expected that all acute hospitals and 
all neuroscience units accepting 
patients directly from an incident will 
have these resources, and that these",52,RIGHT,195,Page 52 (RIGHT)
chunk_53_LEFT,"60
 
Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
resources will be appropriate for a 
patient’s age. (D) 
3.4.2.6 
[Amended] Patients who have 
sustained a head injury and present 
with any of the following risk factors 
should have full cervical spine 
immobilisation attempted unless other 
factors prevent this: 
- 
GCS less than 15 on initial assessment 
by the healthcare professional  
- 
neck pain or tenderness 
- 
focal neurological deficit 
- 
paraesthesia in the extremities 
- 
any other clinical suspicion of cervical 
spine injury. (D)  
3.4.2.7 
[Amended] Cervical spine 
immobilisation should be maintained 
until full risk assessment including 
clinical assessment (and imaging if 
deemed necessary) indicates it is safe 
to remove the immobilisation device. 
3.4.2.8 
Standby calls to the destination 
emergency department should be 
made for all patients with a GCS less 
than or equal to 8, to ensure 
appropriately experienced 
professionals are available for their 
treatment and to prepare for imaging. 
3.4.2.9 
[New] Pain should be managed 
effectively because it can lead to a rise 
in intracranial pressure. Reassurance 
and splintage of limb fractures are 
helpful; catheterisation of a full",53,LEFT,188,Page 53 (LEFT)

should be given only under the 
direction of a doctor.

Assessment and investigation in the 
emergency department 
3.5.1 
Good practice in emergency 
department assessment 
The main focus of emergency 
department assessment for patients 
who have sustained a head injury 
should be the risk of clinically 
important brain injuries and injuries to 
the cervical spine and the consequent 
need for imaging. Due attention 
should also be paid to co-existing 
injuries and to other concerns the 
clinician may have (for example, nonaccidental injury, possible nontraumatic aetiology such as seizure). 
Early imaging, rather than admission 
and observation for neurological 
deterioration, will reduce the time to 
detection of life-threatening 
complications and is associated with 
better outcomes. 
3.5.1.1 
The priority for all emergency 
department patients is the stabilisation 
of airway, breathing and circulation 
(ABC) before attention to other injuries. 
3.5.1.2 
Depressed conscious level should be 
ascribed to intoxication only after a 
significant brain injury has been 
excluded.(D) 
3.5.1.3 
All emergency department clinicians

with a head injury should be capable 
of assessing the presence or absence 
of the risk factors in the guidance on 
patient selection and urgency for 
imaging (head and cervical spine – 
see later recommendations). Training 
should be available as required to 
ensure that this is the case. (D) 
3.5.1.4 
Patients presenting to the emergency 
department with impaired 
consciousness (GCS less than 15) 
should be assessed immediately by a 
trained member of staff. (D) 
3.5.1.5 
In patients with a GCS less than or 
equal to 8 there should be early 
involvement of an anaesthetist or 
critical care physician to provide 
appropriate airway management, as 
described in recommendations  3.6.1.7 
and 3.6.1.8 to assist with resuscitation. 
3.5.1.6 
All patients presenting to an 
emergency department with a head 
injury should be assessed by a trained 
member of staff within a maximum of 
15 minutes of arrival at hospital. Part 
of this assessment should establish 
whether they are high risk or low risk 
for clinically important brain injury 
and/or cervical spine injury, using the 
guidance on patient selection and 
urgency for imaging (head and 
cervical spine – see later 
recommendations). (D) 
3.5.1.7 
[Amended] In patients considered to 
be at high risk for clinically important 
brain injury and/or cervical spine 
injury, assessment should be extended 
to full clinical examination to establish",54,LEFT,233,Page 54 (LEFT)
chunk_54_RIGHT,"the need to request CT imaging of the 
head and/or imaging of the cervical 
spine. The guidance on patient 
selection and urgency for imaging 
(head and cervical spine) should form 
the basis for the final decision on 
imaging after discussion with the 
radiology department. See 
recommendations 3.5.3.1 to 3.5.4.2 
(imaging of the head) and 3.5.5.1 to 
3.5.7.2 (imaging of the cervical spine). 
3.5.1.8 
[Amended] Patients who, on initial 
assessment, are considered to be at 
low risk for clinically important brain 
injury and/or cervical spine injury 
should be re-examined within a 
further hour by an emergency 
department clinician. Part of this 
assessment should fully establish the 
need to request CT imaging of the 
head and/or imaging of the cervical 
spine. The guidance on patient 
selection and urgency for imaging 
(head and cervical spine) should again 
form the basis for the final decision on 
imaging after discussion with the 
radiology department. See 
recommendations 3.5.3.1 to 3.5.4.2 
(imaging of the head) and 3.5.5.1 to 
3.5.7.2 (imaging of the cervical spine). 
3.5.1.9 
 [NEW] Pain should be managed 
effectively because it can lead to a rise 
in intracranial pressure. Reassurance 
and splintage of limb fractures are 
helpful; catheterisation of a full 
bladder will reduce irritability.

baseline cardiorespiratory 
measurements.   
3.5.1.10 [Amended] Throughout the hospital 
episode, all healthcare professionals 
should use a standard head injury 
proforma in their documentation when 
assessing and observing patients with 
head injury. This form should be of a 
consistent format across all clinical 
departments and hospitals in which a 
patient might be treated. A separate 
proforma for those under 16 years 
should be used. Areas to allow extra 
documentation should be included (for 
example, in cases of non-accidental 
injury). (Examples of proformas that 
should be used in patients with head 
injury are provided in Appendices J, 
K1 and K2). (D) 
3.5.1.11 It is recommended that in-hospital 
observation of patients with a head 
injury, including all emergency 
department observation, should only 
be conducted by professionals 
competent in the assessment of head 
injury. (D) 
3.5.1.12 Patients who returned to an emergency 
department within 48 hours of 
discharge with any persistent 
complaint relating to the initial head 
injury should be seen by or discussed 
with a senior clinician experienced in 
head injuries, and considered for a CT 
scan. (B)

Investigations for clinically important 
brain injuries 
3.5.2.1 
The current primary investigation of 
choice for the detection of acute",55,LEFT,210,Page 55 (LEFT)
chunk_55_RIGHT,"clinically important brain injuries is CT 
imaging of the head. (A) 
3.5.2.2 
For safety, logistic and resource 
reasons, magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) scanning is not currently 
indicated as the primary investigation 
for clinically important brain injury in 
patients who have sustained a head 
injury, although it is recognised that 
additional information of importance 
to the patient’s prognosis can 
sometimes be detected using MRI. (D) 
3.5.2.3 
MRI is contraindicated in both head 
and cervical spine investigations 
unless there is absolute certainty that 
the patient does not harbour an 
incompatible device, implant or 
foreign body. (D) 
3.5.2.4 
There should be appropriate 
equipment for maintaining and 
monitoring the patient within the MRI 
environment and all staff involved 
should be aware of the dangers and 
necessary precautions for working 
near an MRI scanner.  (D) 
3.5.2.5 
[NEW] Plain X-rays of the skull should 
not be used to diagnose significant 
brain injury without prior discussion 
with a neuroscience unit. However, 
they are useful as part of the skeletal 
survey in children presenting with 
suspected non-accidental injury.  
3.5.2.6 
[NEW] Unless the CT result is required 
within 1 hour, it is acceptable to admit 
a patient for effective overnight 
observation and delay the CT scan 
until the next morning if the patient 
presents out of hours and any of the 
following risk factors are present in",55,RIGHT,218,Page 55 (RIGHT)

addition to a period of loss of 
consciousness or amnesia: 
- age 65 years or older 
- amnesia for events more than 30 
minutes before impact 
- dangerous mechanism of injury (a 
pedestrian or cyclist struck by a motor 
vehicle, an occupant ejected from a 
motor vehicle or a fall from a height of 
greater than 1 metre or five stairs).  
3.5.2.7 
[NEW] If CT imaging is unavailable 
because of equipment failure, patients 
with GCS 15 may be admitted for 
observation. Arrangements should be 
in place for urgent transfer to a centre 
with CT scanning available should 
there be a clinical deterioration that 
indicates immediate CT scanning is 
necessary.

3.5.3.1 
[Amended] Adult patients who have 
sustained a head injury and present 
with any one of the following risk 
factors should have CT scanning of the 
head requested immediately:  
- GCS less than 13 on initial 
assessment in the emergency 
department. 
- GCS less than 15 at 2 hours after the 
injury on assessment in the emergency

CT should also be requested 
immediately in patients with any of 
the following risk factors, provided 
they have experienced some loss of

Investigation for injuries to the cervical 
spine 
3.5.5.1 
[Amended] The current initial 
investigation of choice for the 
detection of injuries to the cervical 
spine is the plain radiograph. Three 
views should be obtained and be of 
sufficient quality for reliable 
interpretation. However, in certain 
circumstances CT is preferred. (B) 
3.5.5.2 
As a minimum, CT should cover any 
areas of concern or uncertainty on 
plain film or clinical grounds. (B) 
3.5.5.3 
With modern multislice scanners the 
whole cervical spine can be scanned 
at high resolution with ease and",58,LEFT,229,Page 58 (LEFT)

there is suspicion of vascular injury 
(for example, subluxation or 
displacement of the spinal column, 
fracture through foramen 
transversarium or lateral processes, 
posterior circulation syndromes). (B)

MRI may add important information 
about soft tissue injuries associated 
with bony injuries demonstrated by 
plain films and/or CT. (B)

MRI has a role in the assessment of 
ligamentous and disc injuries

Selection of patients for imaging of the 
cervical spine 
3.5.6.1 
[Amended] Adult patients should have 
three-view radiographic imaging of 
the cervical spine requested 
immediately if any of the following 
points apply: 
- There is neck pain or midline 
tenderness with:  
o Age 65 years or older, or 
o dangerous mechanism of injury (fall 
from greater than 1 metre or five 
stairs; axial load to head for example, 
diving; high-speed motor vehicle 
collision; rollover motor accident; 
ejection from a motor vehicle; accident 
involving motorized recreational 
vehicles; bicycle collision). 
- It is not considered safe to assess 
the range of movement in the neck for 
reasons other than those above. 
- It is considered safe to assess the 
range of movement in the neck and, 
on assessment, the patient cannot 
actively rotate the neck to 45 degrees 
to the left and right; safe assessment 
can be carried out if the patient: 
o was involved in a simple rear-end 
motor vehicle collision 
o is comfortable in a sitting position in 
the emergency department 
o has been ambulatory at any time 
since injury with no midline cervical 
spine tenderness",59,LEFT,203,Page 59 (LEFT)

pain. 
- A definitive diagnosis of cervical 
spine injury is required urgently (for 
example, before surgery). (A) 
3.5.6.2 
[NEW] Adult patients who have any of 
the following risk factors should have 
CT imaging of the cervical spine 
requested immediately: 
- GCS below 13 on initial assessment 
- Has been intubated 
- Plain film series is technically 
inadequate (for example, desired view 
unavailable), suspicious or definitely 
abnormal  
- Continued clinical suspicion of injury 
despite a normal X ray. 
- The patient is being scanned for 
multi-region trauma.

Urgency in performing  cervical spine 
imaging 
3.5.7.1 
[NEW] Children under 10 years of age 
with GCS of 8 or less should have CT 
imaging of the cervical spine within 1 
hour of presentation or when they are 
sufficiently stable. 
3.5.7.2 
[Amended] Imaging of the cervical spine 
should be performed within 1 hour of a 
request having been received by the 
radiology department or when the patient 
is sufficiently stable. Where a request for 
urgent CT imaging of the head (that is, 
within 1 hour) has also been received, the 
cervical spine imaging should be carried 
out simultaneously. (D) 
3.5.8 
Investigations of non-accidental injury 
in children 
3.5.8.1 
[Amended] A clinician with expertise 
in non-accidental injuries in children 
should be involved in any suspected 
case of non-accidental injury in a 
child. Examinations/investigations that 
should be considered include: skull Xray as part of a skeletal survey, 
ophthalmoscopic examination for 
retinal haemorrhage, and examination 
for pallor, anaemia, and tense 
fontanelle or other suggestive features. 
Other imaging such as CT and MRI 
may be required to define injuries.

Involving the neurosurgeon 
3.5.10.1 The care of all patients with new, 
surgically significant abnormalities on 
imaging should be discussed with a 
neurosurgeon. The definition of 
‘surgically significant’ should be 
developed by local neurosurgical 
centres and agreed with referring 
hospitals. An example of a 
neurosurgical referral letter is shown 
in Appendix L. (D) 
3.5.10.2 Regardless of imaging, other reasons 
for discussing a patient’s care plan 
with a neurosurgeon include: 
- persisting coma (GCS  8) after 
initial resuscitation. 
- 
unexplained confusion which 
persists for more than 4 hours 
- 
deterioration in GCS after 
admission (greater attention 
should be paid to motor response 
deterioration) 
- 
progressive focal neurological 
signs 
- 
a seizure without full recovery 
- 
definite or suspected penetrating 
injury 
- 
a cerebrospinal fluid leak. (D)",60,RIGHT,152,Page 60 (RIGHT)

3.5.11 
Admission 
3.5.11.1 The following patients meet the criteria 
for admission to hospital following a 
head injury. 
- 
Patients with new, clinically 
significant abnormalities on 
imaging. 
- 
Patients who have not returned to 
GCS 15 after imaging, regardless 
of the imaging results. 
- 
When a patient fulfils the criteria 
for CT scanning but this cannot be 
done within the appropriate 
period, either because CT is not 
available or because the patient is 
not sufficiently cooperative to 
allow scanning. 
- Continuing worrying signs (for 
example, persistent vomiting, severe 
headaches) of concern to the clinician. 
- Other sources of concern to the 
clinician (for example, drug or alcohol 
intoxication, other injuries, shock, 
suspected non-accidental injury, 
meningism, cerebrospinal fluid leak). 
3.5.11.2 [Amended] Some patients may require 
an extended period in a recovery 
setting because of the use of general 
anaesthesia during CT imaging. (D) 
3.5.11.3 Patients with multiple injuries should 
be admitted under the care of the team 
that is trained to deal with their most 
severe and urgent problem. (D) 
3.5.11.4 [Amended] In circumstances where a 
patient with a head injury requires",61,LEFT,197,Page 61 (LEFT)
chunk_61_RIGHT,"hospital admission, it is recommended 
that the patient be admitted only under 
the care of a team led by a consultant 
who has been trained in the 
management of this condition during 
his/her higher specialist training. The 
consultant and his/her team should 
have competence (defined by local 
agreement with the neuroscience unit) 
in assessment, observation and 
indications for imaging (see 
recommendations 3.7); inpatient 
management; indications for transfer 
to a neuroscience unit (see 
recommendations 3.6); and hospital 
discharge and follow up (see 
recommendations 3.8). (D) 
3.5.11.5 It is recommended that in-hospital 
observation of patients with a head 
injury should only be conducted by 
professionals competent in the 
assessment of head injury. (D) 
3.6 
Transfer from secondary settings to a 
neuroscience unit 
3.6.1 
Transfer of adults 
3.6.1.1 
[Amended] Local guidelines on the 
transfer of patients with head injuries 
should be drawn up between the 
referring hospital trusts, the 
neuroscience unit and the local 
ambulance service, and should 
recognise that: 
- transfer would benefit all patients 
with serious head injuries (GCS  8), 
irrespective of the need for 
neurosurgery 
- if transfer of those who do not 
require neurosurgery is not possible,",61,RIGHT,189,Page 61 (RIGHT)

Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
ongoing liaison with the neuroscience 
unit over clinical management is 
essential.  (D) 
3.6.1.2 
[NEW] The possibility of occult 
extracranial injuries should be 
considered for the multiply injured 
adult, and he or she should not be 
transferred to a service that is unable 
to deal with other aspects of trauma. 
3.6.1.3 
There should be a designated 
consultant in the referring hospital 
with responsibility for establishing 
arrangements for the transfer of 
patients with head injuries to a 
neuroscience unit and another 
consultant at the neuroscience unit 
with responsibility for establishing 
arrangements for communication with 
referring hospitals and for receipt of 
patients transferred. (D) 
3.6.1.4 
[Amended] Patients with head injuries 
requiring emergency transfer to a 
neuroscience unit should be 
accompanied by a doctor with 
appropriate training and experience in 
the transfer of patients with acute 
brain injury. The doctor should be 
familiar with the pathophysiology of 
head injury, the drugs and equipment 
they will use and with working in the 
confines of an ambulance (or 
helicopter if appropriate). They should 
have a dedicated and adequately 
trained assistant. They should be 
provided with appropriate clothing for 
the transfer, medical indemnity and 
personal accident insurance. Patients 
requiring non-emergency transfer 
should be accompanied by appropriate 
clinical staff. (D)",62,LEFT,219,Page 62 (LEFT)
chunk_62_RIGHT,"3.6.1.5 
The transfer team should be provided 
with a means of communication with 
their base hospital and the 
neurosurgical unit during the transfer. 
A portable phone may be suitable 
providing it is not used in close 
proximity (that is, within 1 metre) of 
medical equipment prone to electrical 
interference (for example, infusion 
pumps). (D) 
3.6.1.6 
[Amended] Although it is understood 
that transfer is often urgent, initial 
resuscitation and stabilisation of the 
patient should be completed and 
comprehensive monitoring established 
before transfer to avoid complications 
during the journey. A patient who is 
persistently hypotensive, despite 
resuscitation, should not be 
transported until the cause of the 
hypotension has been identified and 
the patient stabilised. (D) 
3.6.1.7 
All patients with a GCS less than or 
equal to 8 requiring transfer to a 
neurosurgical unit should be intubated 
and ventilated as should any patients 
with the indications detailed in 
recommendation 3.6.1.8. (D) 
3.6.1.8 
[Amended] Intubation and ventilation 
should be used immediately in the 
following circumstances: 
- Coma – not obeying commands, not 
speaking, not eye opening (that is, 
GCS  8). 
- Loss of protective laryngeal reflexes. 
- Ventilatory insufficiency as judged 
by blood gases: hypoxaemia (PaO2< 
13 kPa on oxygen) or hypercarbia 
(PaCO2 > 6 kPa).",62,RIGHT,203,Page 62 (RIGHT)

- Spontaneous hyperventilation 
causing PaCO2 < 4 kPa. 
- Irregular respirations. (D). 
3.6.1.9 
[Amended] Intubation and ventilation 
should be used before the start of the 
journey in the following 
circumstances: 
- Significantly deteriorating conscious 
level (one or more points on the motor 
score), even if not coma. 
- Unstable fractures of the facial 
skeleton. 
- Copious bleeding into mouth (for 
example, from skull base fracture). 
- Seizures. (D) 
3.6.1.10  [Amended] An intubated patient 
should be ventilated with muscle 
relaxation and appropriate shortacting sedation and analgesia. Aim for 
a PaO2 greater than 13 kPa, PaCO2 4.5 
to 5.0 kPa unless there is clinical or 
radiological evidence of raised 
intracranial pressure, in which case 
more aggressive hyperventilation is 
justified. If hyperventilation is used, 
the inspired oxygen concentration 
should be increased. The mean arterial 
pressure should be maintained at 80 
mmHg or more by infusion of fluid 
and vasopressors as indicated. In 
children, blood pressure should be 
maintained at a level appropriate for 
the child’s age. (D) 
3.6.1.11 Education, training and audit are 
crucial to improving standards of 
transfer; appropriate time and funding 
for these activities should be provided.",63,LEFT,203,Page 63 (LEFT)

Transfer of children 
3.6.2.1 
The recommendations in section 3.6.1 
were written for adults but the 
principles apply equally to children 
and infants, providing that the 
paediatric modification of the Glasgow 
Coma Scale is used. (D) 
3.6.2.2 
Service provision in the area of 
paediatric transfer to tertiary care 
should also follow the principles 
outlined in the National Service 
Framework for Paediatric Intensive 
Care. These do not conflict with the 
principles outlined in 3.6.1. (D) 
3.6.2.3 
[NEW] The possibility of occult 
extracranial injuries should be 
considered for the multiply injured 
child, and he or she should not be 
transferred to a service that is unable 
to deal with other aspects of trauma. 
3.6.2.4 
Transfer of a child or infant to a 
specialist neurosurgical unit should be 
undertaken by staff experienced in the 
transfer of critically ill children. (D)

Observation of admitted patients 
3.7.1 
Training in observation 
3.7.1.1 
Medical, nursing and other staff caring 
for patients with head injury admitted 
for observation should all be capable 
of performing the observations listed 
in 3.7.2 and 3.7.5.  
3.7.1.2 
The acquisition and maintenance of 
observation and recording skills 
require dedicated training and this 
should be available to all relevant 
staff.  
3.7.1.3 
Specific training is required for the 
observation of infants and young 
children. (D) 
3.7.2 
Minimum documented observations 
3.7.2.1 
For patients admitted for head injury 
observation the minimum acceptable 
documented neurological observations 
are: GCS; pupil size and reactivity; 
limb movements; respiratory rate; 
heart rate; blood pressure; 
temperature; blood oxygen saturation. 
3.7.3 
Frequency of observations 
3.7.3.1 
Observations should be performed 
and recorded on a half-hourly basis 
until GCS equal to 15 has been 
achieved. The minimum frequency of 
observations for patients with GCS 
equal to 15 should be as follows, 
starting after the initial assessment in 
the emergency department: 
- half-hourly for 2 hours 
- then 1-hourly for 4 hours 
- then 2-hourly thereafter.",64,LEFT,189,Page 64 (LEFT)
chunk_64_RIGHT,"3.7.3.2 
Should a patient with GCS equal to 15 
deteriorate at any time after the initial 
2-hour period, observations should 
revert to half-hourly and follow the 
original frequency schedule. (D) 
3.7.4 
Observationof children and infants 
3.7.4.1 
Observation of infants and young 
children (that is, aged under 5 years) is 
a difficult exercise and therefore 
should only be performed by units 
with staff experienced in the 
observation of infants and young 
children with a head injury. Infants 
and young children may be observed 
in normal paediatric observation 
settings, as long as staff have the 
appropriate experience. (D) 
3.7.5 
Patients changes requiring review 
while under observation 
3.7.5.1 
[Amended] Any of the following 
examples of neurological deterioration 
should prompt urgent reappraisal by 
the supervising doctor: 
- Development of agitation or 
abnormal behaviour. 
- A sustained (that is, for at least 30 
minutes) drop of one point in GCS 
(greater weight should be given to a 
drop of one point in the motor 
response score of the Glasgow Coma 
Scale). 
- Any drop of three or more points in 
the eye-opening or verbal response 
scores of the Glasgow Coma Scale, or 
two or more points in the motor 
response score.",64,RIGHT,196,Page 64 (RIGHT)

Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
- Development of severe or increasing 
headache or persisting vomiting. 
- New or evolving neurological 
symptoms or signs such as pupil 
inequality or asymmetry of limb or 
facial movement. (D) 
3.7.5.2 
To reduce inter-observer variability 
and unnecessary referrals, a second 
member of staff competent to perform 
observation should confirm 
deterioration before involving the 
supervising doctor. This confirmation 
should be carried out immediately. 
Where a confirmation cannot be 
performed immediately (for example, 
no staff member available to perform 
the second observation) the 
supervising doctor should be contacted 
without the confirmation being 
performed. (D)

Imaging following confimed patient 
deterioration 
3.7.6.1 
[Amended] If any of the changes 
noted in 1.7.5.1 above are confirmed, 
an immediate CT scan should be 
considered, and the patient’s clinical 
condition should be re-assessed and 
managed appropriately. (D) 
3.7.7 
Further imaging if GCS equal to 15 not 
achieved at 24 hours 
3.7.7.1 
In the case of a patient who has had a 
normal CT scan but who has not 
achieved GCS 15 after 24 hours’ 
observation, a further CT scan or MRI 
scanning should be considered and 
discussed with the radiology

No patients presenting with head 
injury should be discharged until they 
have achieved GCS equal to 15, or 
normal consciousness in infants and 
young children as assessed by the 
paediatric version of the Glasgow 
Coma Scale. (D) 
3.8.2 
Discharge advice 
3.8.2.1 
All patients with any degree of head 
injury who are deemed safe for 
appropriate discharge from an 
emergency department or the 
observation ward should receive 
verbal advice and a written head 
injury advice card. The details of the 
card should be discussed with the 
patients and their carers. If necessary 
(for example, patients with literacy 
problems, visual impairment or 
speaking languages without a written 
format), other formats (for example, 
tapes) should be used to communicate 
this information.  Communication in 
languages other than English should 
also be facilitated. (D) 
3.8.2.2 
The risk factors outlined in the card 
should be the same as those used in 
the initial community setting to advise 
patients on emergency department 
attendance. Patients and carers should 
also be alerted to the possibility that 
some patients may make a quick 
recovery, but go on to experience 
delayed complications. Instructions

3.9 
New Recommendations 
3.9.1 
Pre-hospital management 
3.9.1.1 
Pain should be managed effectively 
because it can lead to a rise in 
intracranial pressure. Reassurance and 
splintage of limb fractures are helpful; 
catheterisation of a full bladder will 
reduce irritability. Analgesia as 
described in 3.5.1.9 should be given 
only under the direction of a doctor. 
3.9.2 
Investigations for clinically important 
brain injuries 
3.9.2.1 
Plain X-rays of the skull should not be 
used to diagnose significant brain injury 
without prior discussion with a 
neuroscience unit. However, they are 
useful as part of the skeletal survey in 
children presenting with suspected nonaccidental injury.  
3.9.2.2 
Unless the CT result is required within 1 
hour, it is acceptable to admit a patient 
for effective overnight observation and 
delay the CT scan until the next morning 
if the patient presents out of hours and 
any of the following risk factors are 
present in addition to a period of loss of 
consciousness or amnesia: 
 age 65 years or older",68,LEFT,230,Page 68 (LEFT)
chunk_68_RIGHT," amnesia for events more than 30 
minutes before impact 
 dangerous mechanism of injury (a 
pedestrian or cyclist struck by a motor 
vehicle, an occupant ejected from a 
motor vehicle or a fall from a height of 
greater than 1 metre or five stairs).  
3.9.2.3 
If CT imaging is unavailable because of 
equipment failure, patients with GCS 15 
may be admitted for observation. 
Arrangements should be in place for 
urgent transfer to a centre with CT 
scanning available should there be a 
clinical deterioration that indicates 
immediate CT scanning is necessary.

Selection of patients for CT imaging of 
the head 
3.9.3.1 
Children (under 16 years) who have 
sustained a head injury and present with 
any one of the following risk factors 
should have CT scanning of the head

5 minutes (witnessed). 
 Amnesia (antegrade or retrograde) 
lasting more than 5 minutes. 
 
Abnormal drowsiness. 
 Three or more discrete episodes of 
vomiting. 
 Clinical suspicion of non-accidental 
injury. 
 Post-traumatic seizure but no history 
of epilepsy. 
 GCS less than 14, or for a baby

department. 
 Suspicion of open or depressed skull 
injury or tense fontanelle. 
 Any sign of basal skull fracture 
(haemotympanum, ‘panda’ eyes, 
cerebrospinal fluid leakage from the 
ear or nose, Battle’s sign).

projectile or an object).   
3.9.4 
Selection of patients for imaging of the 
cervical spine 
3.9.4.1

following risk factors should have CT 
imaging of the cervical spine requested 
immediately:",69,LEFT,142,Page 69 (LEFT)

 Has been intubated 
 Plain film series is technically 
inadequate (for example, desired view 
unavailable), suspicious or definitely 
abnormal  
 Continued clinical suspicion of injury 
despite a normal X ray. 
 The patient is being scanned for multiregion trauma.  
3.9.5 
Selection of patients for imaging of the 
cervical spine 
3.9.5.1 
In children under 10 years, because of 
the increased risks associated with 
irradiation, particularly to the thyroid 
gland, and the generally lower risk of 
significant spinal injury, CT of the 
cervical spine should be used only in 
cases where patients have a severe 
head injury (GCS  8), or where there is 
a strong clinical suspicion of injury 
despite normal plain films (for example, 
focal neurological signs or paraesthesia 
in the extremities), or where plain films 
are technically difficult or inadequate.  
3.9.6 
Urgency in performing  cervical spine 
imaging 
3.9.6.1

GCS of 8 or less should have CT 
imaging of the cervical spine within 1 
hour of presentation or when they are 
sufficiently stable.

sufficiently stable.  
3.9.8 
Transfer of adults 
3.9.8.1 
The possibility of occult extracranial 
injuries should be considered for the 
multiply injured adult, and he or she 
should not be transferred to a service 
that is unable to deal with other aspects 
of trauma.

Recommendations for research 
The GDG identified the following 
priority area for research. 
3.10.1 
Is the clinical outcome of head injury 
patients with a reduced level of 
consciousness improved by direct 
transport from the scene of injury to a 
tertiary centre with neurosciences 
facilities compared with the outcome 
of those who are transported initially 
to the nearest hospital without 
neurosurgical facilities? 
The aim of this study is to conduct a 
comparison in patient outcome 
(mortality/morbidity) for those head 
injured patients that are transported 
directly to a centre with neurosciences 
facilities with the outcomes of those who 
are transported to the nearest hospital 
without neurosciences facilities, possibly 
necessitating a secondary transfer. 
Patients suffering from serious head 
injuries with a reduced level of 
consciousness are currently transported 
to the nearest hospital by land 
ambulance or helicopter. The nearest 
hospital may not have the resources or 
expertise to provide definitive care for 
these patients. Patients should be",70,LEFT,218,Page 70 (LEFT)
chunk_70_RIGHT,"followed as they pass through the care 
system with mortality and morbidity 
outcomes collected. These should be 
compared to allow, using sub-group 
analysis, the identification of patients for 
whom direct transfer is most beneficial. 
3.10.1.1 Why this research is important 
Limited evidence in this area has shown 
that patients do better in terms of 
outcome if they are transported directly 
to a neurosciences centre when 
compared to those who are taken to the 
nearest district general hospital. This 
evidence however does not appear to 
have influenced current practice. For 
people working in the prehospital arena, 
it is important to define which patients 
who have sustained a head injury would 
do better by being transported directly 
to a neurosciences centre. 
Currently patients are either always 
transported to the nearest district 
general hospital as is the case in most 
land vehicle deployment or in some 
organisations especially those involving 
helicopter emergency medical services 
the decision is left to the judgement of 
the clinicians at the scene. Those patients 
transported to the nearest district 
general hospital may suffer a significant 
delay in receiving definitive treatment 
for their head injury. Information from 
such research can help to define which 
patients should be transported direct to 
a neurosciences centre bypassing the 
nearest hospital.  
Guidance will be required to define the 
patient population for example, 
researchers may focus on isolated",70,RIGHT,224,Page 70 (RIGHT)

injuries or head injuries associated with 
multi trauma. Further specification about 
what level of consciousness would be 
suitable for primary transfer to a 
neurosciences unit would be required. 
Researchers should look at the impact of 
the duration of transport on study 
outcome. So for a journey time to the 
neurosciences unit of less than 20 
minutes, direct transport might improve 
outcomes, (as concluded by the London 
Severe Injury Working Group) but 
beyond this time, direct transport might 
worsen outcomes.   
In addition to measuring changes in 
morbidity and mortality, the costeffectiveness of direct transport should 
be modelled in terms of the cost per 
quality-adjusted life-year gained. A 
protype model was produced for the 
2007 update of this guideline (1.1.1). 
3.10.2 
Research is needed to establish the 
validity of previously derived clinical 
decision rules on the selection of head 
injured infants and children for CT 
scanning to exclude significant brain 
injury.  
3.10.2.1 Why this research is important 
The 2002 NICE guidelines recommended 
that children be selected for CT scanning 
on the basis of the Canadian Head CT 
rule, a clinical decision rule derived and 
validated in adults. This was due to the 
absence of such a rule derived in 
children. However since this date the 
CHALICE rule has been published which 
presents a clinical decision rule derived 
in a large group of children and infants",71,LEFT,240,Page 71 (LEFT)
chunk_71_RIGHT,"from the UK with good sensitivity and 
specificity.  
However, clinical decision rules often 
provide an overestimate of their 
performance when applied to new 
populations. We now recommend the 
usage of the CHALICE rule for children 
suffering a head injury in the UK, with 
the caveat that a validation of the rule 
in a new population of head injured UK 
patients be urgently undertaken to 
ensure its reliability and reproducibility.    
Such a study is now essential and 
performing a validation of the CHALICE 
study in a novel UK population may 
easily be performed in a 1-2 year 
timeframe with acceptable costs, and 
considerable benefits in terms of 
assuring clinicians as to the safety of this 
novel rule.  
3.10.3 
Research is needed to develop 
consensus on criteria for lesions not 
currently considered to be surgically 
significant following imaging of a 
patient with head injury. 
Although most neurosurgeons agree 
about which extradural and subdural 
haematomas should be removed, there is 
controversy about whether or not to 
remove traumatic intracerebral 
haemorrhage (TICH) and cerebral 
contusions (CC). A prospective 
randomised controlled trial (PRCT) 
should be set up to discover if early 
surgery improves the outcome in these 
lesions compared to initial conservative 
treatment. 
3.10.3.1 Why this research is important",71,RIGHT,204,Page 71 (RIGHT)
chunk_72_LEFT,"79
 
Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
One option in the management of 
traumatic intracerebral haemorrhage 
(TICH) and cerebral contusions (CC) is to 
monitor the patient clinically or with 
Intracranial Pressure Monitoring and 
other forms of brain tissue monitoring 
such as brain tissue oxygen (BtO2) or 
microdialysis. When the patient 
deteriorates, he or she is rushed to the 
operating theatre. The problem is that 
this approach has never been validated 
in a prospective randomised controlled 
trial (PRCT). Waiting until there is 
deterioration in the level of consciousness 
(LOC) or until there is deterioration in 
the monitoring parameters builds delay 
into the management and results in 
secondary brain damage occurring and 
becoming established before surgery in 
all such cases. The principle of early 
surgical evacuation of spontaneous 
intracerebral haemorrhage (SICH) has 
been investigated in the surgical trial in 
intracerebral haemorrhage (STICH) and 
reported in the Lancet (2005). The 
results of such a PRCT in TICH would 
fundamentally alter the 
recommendations made by NICE, in 
terms of which patients should be 
referred to neurosurgery and, more 
importantly, how their care should be 
managed there. There is no level 1 
evidence about what to do with these 
patients and the need for such a PRCT in 
head injured patients is urgent. This 
research question should immediately be 
put to UK research funding bodies. 
3.10.4 
Do patients with significant traumatic 
brain injury who do not require 
operative neurosurgical intervention at",72,LEFT,246,Page 72 (LEFT)
chunk_72_RIGHT,"presentation, but are still cared for in 
specialist neurosciences centres, have 
improved clinical outcomes when 
compared to similar patients who are 
treated in non-specialist centres?  
3.10.4.1 Why this research is important 
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is amongst 
the most important causes of death in 
young adults, with an overall mortality 
for severe TBI of over 50%. TBI care 
consumes one million acute hospital beddays, and over 15,000 ICU bed-days 
annually, and patients who do survive 
significant TBI experience an enormous 
burden of long term physical disability, 
neurocognitive deficits, and 
neuropsychiatric sequelae. The financial 
impact is significant: the NHS spends 
over £1 billion on just the acute hospital 
care of the 10,000 patients with 
significant TBI. The costs of rehabilitation 
and community care are difficult to 
estimate, but probably total many 
multiples of the figure provided for 
acute care. These considerations make 
TBI a national healthcare priority and its 
outcome impact is consistent with its 
inclusion in the National Service 
Framework for Long Term Neurological 
Conditions. 
Current referral of patients with acute 
traumatic brain injury practice is still 
dominated in many parts of the United 
Kingdom by the need for operative 
neurosurgical intervention at 
presentation. This may be inappropriate, 
since many patients with severe head 
injury have evidence of raised 
intracranial pressure in the absence of 
surgical lesions, and suffer morbidity 
and mortality equal to those with",72,RIGHT,226,Page 72 (RIGHT)
chunk_73_LEFT,"80
 
Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
surgical lesions. Further, several studies 
provide strong circumstantial evidence 
that managing such “non-surgical” 
patients in specialist neurosciences 
centres may result in substantial 
improvements in mortality and functional 
outcome, probably due to specialist 
expertise in areas of non-operative 
management, such as neurocritical care. 
However, these results may be 
confounded by case-mix effects and 
referral bias, and the cost-effectiveness 
of such specialist management remains 
uncertain. There is a strong case to 
address this question in the context of a 
formal study, since a change in practice 
could have a major impact on death and 
disability in a condition that is a major 
contributor to mortality in healthy young 
adults.  Importantly, the results of such a 
study could fundamentally alter the 
recommendations made by NICE, in 
terms of where patients with head injury 
are treated within the healthcare system, 
and result in better optimised (and 
potentially more cost-effective) patient 
flows within the NHS. 
The available evidence in this area has 
been addressed in the systematic review 
that contributed to the revision of NICE 
Guidelines on the early management of 
head injury. This review could find no 
high quality clinical evidence on the 
topic. This is unsurprising, since any study 
that addressed these issues would have 
to be undertaken within the context of a 
healthcare system and include 
ambulance services, district general 
hospitals and neuroscience referral 
centres. Such a study would therefore 
require the organisational backing of a 
body such as NICE and careful design to",73,LEFT,259,Page 73 (LEFT)
chunk_73_RIGHT,"account for confounds and biases. 
However, we believe that given careful 
design, such a study would be both 
ethically and logistically feasible. The 
patient group is well defined, and 
adequate numbers would be available 
to provide a definitive result within a 
reasonable time frame. While 
circumstantial evidence may support 
transfer of such patients to neurosciences 
centres, current practice is not influenced 
by this view in many regions, and many 
would argue that there is still clinical 
equipoise in this area. There are clear 
risks from transfer, and there could be 
clear harm, both in terms of clinical 
outcome and health economics, if the 
anticipated benefits were not realised. 
On the other hand, if the benefits from 
observational studies were confirmed by 
the trial, the resulting changes in 
management could potentially reduce 
case-mix adjusted mortality by 26% 
and increase the incidence of favourable 
outcome in survivors by nearly 20%.  
3.10.5 
Research is needed to summarise and 
identify the optimal predictor variables 
for long term sequelae following mild 
traumatic brain injury.  
A systematic review of the literature 
could be used to derive a clinical 
decision rule to identify, at the time of 
injury, relevant patients. This would in 
turn lay the foundation for a derivation 
cohort study. 
3.10.5.1 Why this research is important 
We performed a review of the 
literature in this area, repeated in this 
update process. While 394 studies were",73,RIGHT,230,Page 73 (RIGHT)
chunk_74_LEFT,"81
 
Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
identified that attempted to use a wide 
range of variables and tests to predict a 
range of longer term outcome measures, 
no robust clinical decision tool has 
successfully been derived and validated 
to identify patients at the time of injury 
who could be considered for follow-up 
due to a higher risk of long term 
sequelae. A systematic review of the 
literature would summarise and identify 
the optimal predictor variables for such 
a clinical decision rule and also identify 
the optimal outcome variables, thus 
laying the foundation for a derivation 
cohort study.  
The derivation cohort study to create this 
clinical decision rule could potentially be 
conducted in conjunction with the 
validation of the CHALICE rule, with 
follow up of patients involved in this 
study at 6mths-1yr. This would ensure 
optimal value for money for funders and 
ensure good results in a large cohort of 
patients. Separate studies could also be 
performed in adults but the initial study 
may in fact be more urgent in the 
childhood population.  
Identification of patients likely to suffer 
from long term sequelae will allow 
targeted research regarding 
responsiveness to, or effectiveness of 
focused rehabilitation programmes. 
Preventative action could potentially be 
taken, thus reducing the strain on 
resources further down the care 
pathway. Furthermore, patient outcomes 
could potentially be improved by early 
identification and treatment (both 
curative and preventive) of problems. 
However, further research is required 
before we can be certain that a robust",74,LEFT,254,Page 74 (LEFT)
chunk_74_RIGHT,"framework exists with which to cope with 
individuals identified by the clinical 
prediction rule proposed above.",74,RIGHT,16,Page 74 (RIGHT)

Pre-hospital assessment, advice and 
referral to hospital
4.1 
Predictor variables 
A large number of people sustain head 
injuries each year many of which are 
sufficiently minor to not require medical 
attention. Advice to the public and 
community services should focus on the 
variables known to elevate the risk of 
clinically important brain injury or 
another head wound that may require 
surgical repair. A large number of 
variables have been identified as 
elevating the risk of these outcomes 
after head injury. 
4.2 
Loss of consciousness 
A history of altered consciousness after 
a head injury increases the risk of 
intracranial complications although the 
absolute risk remains low.15,46There is 
controversy regarding the importance of 
momentary loss of consciousness, and the 
variable is, by definition, difficult to 
measure when no independent observer 
is available.  There is evidence that 
intracranial complications can occur even",75,LEFT,157,Page 75 (LEFT)
chunk_75_RIGHT,"when no loss of consciousness has 
occurred, but most studies in this area 
exclude patients who have not 
experienced a loss of consciousness,  
resulting in a paucity of literature on this 
aspect of risk. 
4.3 
Amnesia 
Amnesia after head injury increases the 
risk of intracranial complications, 
although the length and type of amnesia 
are controversial.15,46Amnesia is usually 
defined as post-traumatic (anterograde 
– for events after the trauma) in the 
literature but a recent important study 
has suggested that retrograde amnesia 
(that is, for memories before the",75,RIGHT,86,Page 75 (RIGHT)
chunk_76_LEFT,"83
 
Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
trauma) is a more important risk factor.25 
Amnesia is a less useful predictor 
variable in infants and young children, 
simply because it is difficult to measure. 
4.4 
Neurological signs 
Post-traumatic neurological signs such as 
focal neurological deficits or seizure are 
highly associated with the risk of an 
intracranial complication47 and the risk is 
so large that these patients are 
commonly excluded from studies 
developing clinical decision rules for the 
management of acute head injury.   
4.5 
Bleeding disorders and use of 
anticoagulants 
Patients with coagulopathy have an 
elevated risk of intracranial 
complications but the exact strength of 
this relationship has not been 
established.48,49 
4.6 
Skull fracture 
It is accepted that the risk of intracranial 
complications is higher in patients with a 
diagnosis of skull fracture. It can be 
estimated that the risk of developing an 
intracranial haematoma is about 12 
times higher in patients with a 
radiographically detected skull fracture 
than in patients without this diagnosis, 
based on an estimate of 38% sensitivity 
and 95% specificity produced by a 
meta-analysis of the value of the 
radiological diagnosis of skull fracture.23 
There is variation in diagnostic practice 
for skull fracture. Some guidelines 
advocate the use of skull X-ray in the 
diagnosis of skull fracture,13 while others 
advocate the use of signs alone (for 
example, cerebrospinal fluid leak,",76,LEFT,232,Page 76 (LEFT)
chunk_76_RIGHT,"periorbital haematoma, depressed or 
open skull injury, penetrating injury).25 
4.7 
Age 
An exact age threshold for identifying 
patients at high risk of intracranial 
complications following a head injury 
has not been identified, but it is clear 
that increasing age is associated with an 
increased risk and a poorer prognosis.50 
Commonly used thresholds are 60 
years19,51 and 65 years25,50. To avoid 
confusion, the GDG chose to adopt a 
standard age threshold throughout these 
guidelines of greater than or equal to 
65 years. An odds ratio of 4.1 (95% CI: 
2.8-6.1) for clinically important brain 
injury has been quoted with this 
threshold, providing the patient has 
experienced loss of consciousness or 
amnesia.25 
There is evidence that the prevalence of 
intracranial complications in children and 
infants is much lower than in adults. 
However, this should be weighed against 
the fact that an unknown, but significant, 
proportion of head injuries in children 
are non-accidental. These injuries may 
result in a different pattern of morbidity 
to that seen in adults, and obviously 
require investigation regardless of 
cause. 
4.8 
Mechanism of injury 
High energy injury mechanisms have an 
intuitive appeal in determining the risk 
of intracranial complications but there 
are difficulties with providing an exact 
definition of ‘high energy’. Terms such as 
‘assault’ or ‘road traffic accident’ cover 
a great heterogeneity of circumstance. A 
recent level two study has proposed the",76,RIGHT,225,Page 76 (RIGHT)
chunk_77_LEFT,"84
 
Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
following criteria as high risk factors for 
clinically important brain injuries after 
head injury: pedestrian struck by motor 
vehicle, occupant ejected from motor 
vehicle, or a fall from a height of 
greater than three feet or more than 
five stairs25. A further study has defined 
‘axial load to head’ as a high risk factor 
for cervical spine injury after an 
accident19,52. This covers the following 
areas: diving; high-speed motor vehicle 
collision; rollover motor accident; 
ejection from a motor vehicle; accident 
involving motorized recreational 
vehicles; bicycle collision. In addition, 
there are many other high energy 
mechanism injuries which cannot be 
covered in an exhaustive list (for 
example, the variety of blunt instruments 
that could be used in a violent assault) 
which were considered to be important 
by the GDG. 
UPDATE 2007: 
The height threshold for a high-risk fall is 
sometimes defined as greater than three 
feet, and sometimes as greater than 1 
metre. For the sake of consistency, this 
guideline will use the term ‘1 metre’. The 
recent CHALICE53 rule recognises falls of 
greater then 3 metres were highly 
associated with the development of 
intracranial lesions. 
4.9 
Drug or alcohol intoxication 
Drug or alcohol intoxication can result in 
signs and symptoms which are risk 
factors for intracranial complications (for 
example, vomiting, headache, amnesia, 
impaired consciousness) but have also 
been identified as independent risk 
factors following head injury, making a",77,LEFT,245,Page 77 (LEFT)
chunk_77_RIGHT,"differential diagnosis difficult. 19,54In 
addition, alcohol abuse can lead to 
hypoglycaemia, which can in turn lead to 
impaired consciousness. This may lead to 
the incorrect diagnosis of a developing 
intracranial trauma complication. 
4.10 
Headache 
Headache is a controversial variable in 
the evaluation of risk for intracranial 
complications. In some studies the 
variable has been an important 
predictor 19,55 but not in others.25,56 
Headache can be difficult to define both 
in terms of duration and severity, 
particularly in infants and young 
children. 
4.11 
Vomiting 
Vomiting is consistently identified as a 
high risk variable, but there is some 
controversy regarding the number of 
episodes required to qualify as highrisk.19,25,55,56 Vomiting is also quite 
common in infants and children and its 
predictive power is controversial in this 
age group. It has been estimated that 
around 16% of infants and children 
aged 12 years or less vomit after minor 
head injury, and the cause of vomiting 
often seems to be related to individual 
intrinsic factors (for example, previous 
tendency to vomit) rather than specific 
features of the head injury57. There are 
inconsistencies between the various prehospital advice services in their choice of 
the timescales and number of vomits 
which would arouse concern in children. 
This is a reflection of the lack of 
evidence on which to make a judgment. 
The GDG considered that in a child 
under 12 years who has sustained a",77,RIGHT,229,Page 77 (RIGHT)
chunk_78_LEFT,"85
 
Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
head injury 3 vomits within a 4 hour 
period should be cause for concern even 
when there are no other signs or 
symptoms. 
4.12 
Irritability and altered behaviour 
Irritability and altered behaviour are 
non-specific terms which are sometimes 
used in clinical guidelines for acute head 
injury management with little empirical 
evidence to support their use.13 
However, they may be an important sign 
in the pre-verbal child, where other 
problems like amnesia or headaches 
cannot be detected. 
4.13 
History of cranial neurosurgical 
interventions 
Previous cranial neurosurgical 
interventions have an intuitive 
relationship with risk of intracranial 
complications and were considered 
worthy of inclusion by the GDG despite 
a dearth of empirical evidence on the 
variable. 
4.14 
Public health literature 
Public health literature and other nonmedical sources of advice (for 
example, St John Ambulance, police 
officers) should encourage people who 
have any concerns following a head 
injury to themselves or to another 
person, regardless of the injury 
severity, to seek immediate medical 
advice.  
This is a grade D recommendation 
based on evidence level five. 
4.15 
Telephone advice lines 
[Amended] Telephone advice services 
(for example, NHS Direct, emergency",78,LEFT,201,Page 78 (LEFT)
chunk_78_RIGHT,"department helplines) should refer 
people who have sustained a head 
injury to the emergency ambulance 
services (that is, 999) for emergency 
transport to the emergency 
departments if they have experienced

- Unconsciousness, or lack of full 
consciousness (for example, problems 
keeping eyes open).

general weakness; any changes in 
eyesight; and problems walking).

mechanism). 
- The injured person or their carer is 
incapable of transporting the injured 
person safely to the hospital 
emergency department without the use 
of ambulance services (providing any 
other risk factors indicating emergency 
department referral are present). 
Telephone advice services (for

following risk factors (alternative 
terms to facilitate communication are

- Any previous loss of consciousness 
(‘knocked out’) as a result of the 
injury, from which the injured person 
has now recovered. 
- Amnesia for events before or after 
the injury (‘problems with memory’). 
The assessment of amnesia will not be 
possible in pre-verbal children and is 
unlikely to be possible in any child 
aged under 5 years. 
- Persistent headache since the injury. 
- Any vomiting episodes since the 
injury. 
- Any previous cranial neurosurgical 
interventions (‘brain surgery’).",79,LEFT,197,Page 79 (LEFT)

- Irritability or altered behaviour 
(‘easily distracted’ ‘not themselves’ ‘no 
concentration’ ‘no interest in things 
around them’) particularly in infants 
and young children (that is, aged 
under 5 years). 
- Continuing concern by the helpline 
personnel about the diagnosis. 
In the absence of any of the above 
factors, the helpline should advise the 
injured person to seek medical advice 
from community services (for 
example, general practice) if any of 
the following factors are present: 
- Adverse social factors (for example, 
no-one able to supervise the injured 
person at home). 
- Continuing concern by the injured 
person or their carer about the 
diagnosis.

level five evidence and are considered 
to be grade D recommendations.

consider referral to an emergency 
department if any of the following 
factors are present depending on their 
own judgement of severity.

health services and NHS minor injury 
clinics should be accompanied by a

emergency department.  
- The referring professional should 
determine if an ambulance is required, 
based on the patient's clinical 
condition. If an ambulance is deemed 
not required, public transport and car 
are appropriate means of transport 
providing the patient is accompanied.  
- The referring professional should 
inform the destination hospital (by 
phone) of the impending transfer and 
in non-emergencies a letter 
summarising signs and symptoms 
should be sent with the patient.

the triage skills of other community 
professionals may sometimes be below a 
desirable standard.

General Practitioners, nurses, dentists

Immediate management at the scene 
and transport to hospital
5.1 
Pre-hospital management 
The following principles should be 
adhered to in the immediate care of 
patients who have sustained a head 
injury. 
- [Amended] Adults who have 
sustained a head injury should 
initially be assessed and their care 
managed according to clear principles 
and standard practice, as embodied in: 
the Advanced Trauma Life Support 
(ATLS) course/European Trauma 
course; the International Trauma Life 
Support (ITLS) course; the Pre-hospital 
Trauma Life Support (PHTLS) course; 
the Advanced Trauma Nurse Course 
(ATNC); the Trauma Nursing Core 
Course (TNCC); and the Joint Royal 
Colleges Ambulance Service Liaison 
Committee (JRCALC) Clinical Practice 
Guidelines for Head Trauma. For 
children, clear principles are outlined 
in the Advanced Paediatric Life 
Support (APLS)/European Paediatric 
Life Support (EPLS) course, the Prehospital Paediatric Life Support",82,LEFT,150,Page 82 (LEFT)
chunk_82_RIGHT,"(PHPLS) course and the Paediatric 
Education for Pre-hospital 
Professionals (PEPP) course materials.  
- Ambulance crews should be fully 
trained in the use of the adult and 
paediatric versions of the GCS. 
- Ambulance crews should be trained 
in the detection of non-accidental 
injury and should pass information to 
emergency department personnel 
when the relevant signs and 
symptoms arise. 
- The priority for those administering 
immediate care is to treat first the 
greatest threat to life and avoid further 
harm. 
- [Amended] Patients who have 
sustained a head injury should be 
transported directly to a facility that 
has been identified as having the 
resources necessary to resuscitate, 
investigate and initially manage any 
patient with multiple injuries. It is 
expected that all acute hospitals and 
all neuroscience units accepting 
patients directly from an incident will",82,RIGHT,133,Page 82 (RIGHT)
chunk_83_LEFT,"90
 
Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
have these resources, and that these 
resources will be appropriate for a 
patient’s age.  
- 
[Amended] Patients who have 
sustained a head injury and present 
with any of the following risk factors 
should have full cervical spine 
immobilisation attempted unless other 
factors prevent this: 
 
GCS less than 15 on initial 
assessment by the healthcare 
professional  
 
neck pain or tenderness 
 
focal neurological deficit 
 paraesthesia in the extremities 
 
any other clinical suspicion of 
cervical spine injury.  
- [Amended] Cervical spine 
immobilisation should be maintained 
until full risk assessment including 
clinical assessment (and imaging if 
deemed necessary) indicates it is safe 
to remove the immobilisation device.  
- Standby calls to the destination 
emergency department should be 
made for all patients with a GCS less 
than or equal to 8, to ensure 
appropriately experienced 
professionals are available for their 
treatment and to prepare for imaging.  
These recommendations are based on 
level five evidence and are considered 
to be grade D recommendations. 
- [New] Pain should be managed 
effectively because it can lead to a rise",83,LEFT,193,Page 83 (LEFT)
chunk_83_RIGHT,"in intracranial pressure. Reassurance 
and splintage of limb fractures are 
helpful; catheterisation of a full 
bladder will reduce irritability. 
Analgesia as described in 6.13 should 
be given only under the direction of a 
doctor.  
5.2 
Glasgow Coma Score 
The Glasgow Coma Scale and its 
derivative the Glasgow Coma Score are 
widely used in the assessment and 
monitoring of patients who have 
sustained a head injury59,60. 
The assessment and classification of 
patients who have sustained a head 
injury should be guided primarily by the 
adult and paediatric versions of the 
Glasgow Coma Scale and its derivative 
the Glasgow Coma Score47,61,62. 
Recommended versions are shown in 
Appendix M and Appendix N. Good 
practice in the use of the Glasgow Coma 
Scale and Score should be adhered to 
at all times, following the principles 
below. 
- Monitoring and exchange of 
information about individual patients 
should be based on the three separate 
responses on the GCS (for example, a 
patient scoring 13 based on scores of 4 
on eye-opening, 4 on verbal response 
and 5 on motor response should be 
communicated as E4, V4, M5). 
- If a total score is recorded or 
communicated, it should be based on 
a sum of 15, and to avoid confusion 
this denominator should be specified 
(for example, 13/15).",83,RIGHT,211,Page 83 (RIGHT)
chunk_84_LEFT,"91
 
Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
- The individual components of the 
GCS should be described in all 
communications and every note and 
should always accompany the total 
score. 
- The paediatric version of the GCS 
should include a ‘grimace’ alternative 
to the verbal score to facilitate scoring 
in pre-verbal or intubated patients. 
- Best practice in paediatric coma 
observation and recording as detailed 
by the National Paediatric 
Neuroscience Benchmarking Group 
should be followed at all times. These 
principles are detailed in Appendix N. 
These recommendations are based on 
level five evidence and are considered 
to be grade D recommendations. 
5.3 
Glasgow Coma Scale score 
It is well established that the risk of 
intracranial complications and of 
subsequent need for surgery increases 
as GCS score declines.15,25,46A recent 
study estimated that the rate of clinically 
important brain injury in hospital 
attenders who had experienced some 
loss of consciousness and/or amnesia 
since their head injury increased from 
5% with an initial GCS equal to 15, to 
17% for GCS equal to 14, and to 41% 
for GCS equal to 13.62 A further study 
on paediatric head injury found that a 
GCS less than 13 was a significant 
predictor of an abnormal CT scan in 
children with head injury aged 14 years 
or younger.63",84,LEFT,222,Page 84 (LEFT)
chunk_84_RIGHT,"5.4 
Immediate management of patients with 
severe head injuries 
There are specific questions regarding 
the early management of patients with 
severe head injuries (that is, GCS less 
than or equal to 8). Exhaustive 
systematic reviews have examined 
evidence on the management of severe 
traumatic brain injury.64,65These reviews 
found evidence for only a small number 
of “standards” (that is, recommendations 
generally based on class one evidence 
or strong class two evidence of 
therapeutic effectiveness) and concluded 
that there was a paucity of well 
designed studies examining the efficacy 
of pre-hospital interventions in severe 
head injury. 
Given these findings, no changes to 
current practice were recommended in 
the pre-hospital management of patients 
who have sustained a severe head 
injury. 
5.5 
The benefits of direct transport from the 
scene to a specialist neurosciences centre 
compared to transport to the nearest 
district general hospital 
5.5.1 
Introduction and rationale for the 
clinical question 
This question has been included in this 
update because many healthcare 
professionals, especially ambulance 
staff, may be uncertain when deciding 
on the most appropriate destination for 
a patient with severe head injury. This is 
pertinent as the severity of head injury 
may not be known at the scene and the 
nearest neuroscience unit may be further",84,RIGHT,204,Page 84 (RIGHT)
chunk_85_LEFT,"92
 
Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
away than the emergency department. 
There is also some confusion amongst 
hospital staff with regards to 
interhospital transfer of head injured 
patients. This is because patients who do 
not require surgery but do require 
neurosurgical care may remain in the 
district general hospital (DGH) and 
receive treatment there, when they 
actually require specialist treatment at a 
neuroscience unit. For interhospital 
transfers please see Chapter 7. 
An emergency department is described 
as a local, regional DGH with no 
neurosciences unit or a non specialist 
centre whereas a neurosciences unit is 
described as a specialist centre or a unit 
that has neurosurgical and 
neurointensive care facilities. 
The outcome measures for including 
studies for this review were mortality, 
neurological outcome, disability and 
hospital duration. Studies were excluded 
where; 
x data on head injury patients was not 
provided,  
x the patient group was less than 50% 
head injured patients, 
x  intervention was pre hospital care 
rather than transfer and  
x the outcomes reported only duration 
of transfer and no other outcomes. 
5.5.2 
Clinical evidence 
The first study66 was a retrospective 
observational cohort study (evidence 
level 2+), that obtained data from the 
New York State Trauma Registry from",85,LEFT,210,Page 85 (LEFT)
chunk_85_RIGHT,"1996-1998. This study examined 
patients who were transported to a 
regional/area trauma centre compared 
with patients transferred to non trauma 
centre. The patients in the latter group 
were assessed via the American Triage 
system (pre hospital care) and referred 
directly to a non trauma centre. The 
population were adults (over 13 years) 
with a GCS less than 14. Sub group 
data of 2763 head injured patients 
from a data set of 5419 trauma 
patients were analysed. Group 1 
(n=2272 (82.2%)) patients were 
transported to regional/area trauma 
centre. These patients were assessed via 
American Triage system (pre hospital 
care) and referred directly to the 
emergency department of either a 
regional or area trauma centre. Group 
2 (n=491 (17.8%)) patients were 
assessed via American Triage system 
(pre hospital care) and referred directly 
to a non trauma centre. The limitations of 
this study were that patients were 
categorised as head injured from data 
reported in trauma registry however the 
extent of head injury was unknown, 
because the GCS was classified as less 
than 14. The results of this study66 
showed that the mortality rate of 
immediate transfer to a neurosciences 
centre versus transfer to a non trauma 
centre were in favour of transfer to 
neuroscience centre with an odds ratio 
0.88, CI (0.64-1.22) which did not reach 
statistical significance. 
The second study67 (evidence level 2+) 
described a cohort of paediatric 
patients aged under 20 years old using 
a large national US paediatric trauma 
registry, admitted to one of ninety",85,RIGHT,246,Page 85 (RIGHT)
chunk_86_LEFT,"93
 
Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
paediatric hospitals or trauma centres. 
The cohort compared 3 sub groups 
defined by the site of intubation; in the 
field, in the trauma centre (n=1874) or 
in a non-trauma centre (n=1647). Taking 
the data from the latter two branches, 
risk stratification was performed in 
patients whose degree of head injury 
was measured using the New Injury 
Severity Score (NISS), and the Relative 
Head Injury Severity Scale (RHISS). The 
main outcomes were unadjusted 
mortality rates and functional outcomes. 
Patients who were assessed using the 
different scales had no significant 
differences in outcome or the place of 
intubation. Mortality (observed vs 
expected) rate in group 1 was 16.5% 
and in group 2 was 13.3%. 
Stratification of injury by NISS or 
degree of head injury showed that 
higher mortality rates were not only 
observed in the severely head injured 
patients who were intubated in a non 
trauma but also the mild and moderate 
head injured patients. Some doubt 
remains over the definition of head 
injured patients as it is unclear if these 
were isolated injury or part of a multiple 
trauma. This affects the conclusions one 
can draw from this study. 
5.5.3 
Economics Evidence from 2007 update 
See economics chapter 11.6 
5.5.4 
Summary of evidence from 2007 
update 
With one study67 it is difficult to draw 
rational conclusions as to the benefits of 
direct transport of patients from the 
scene to either a neurosciences unit or a 
DGH as there is doubt over the",86,LEFT,258,Page 86 (LEFT)
chunk_86_RIGHT,"definition of head injured patients. The 
other study66 showed that the mortality 
rate of immediate transfer to a 
neurosciences centre versus DGH were in 
favour of transport to a neuroscience 
centre. From this evidence review there 
is limited evidence for direct transport of 
head injured patients from the scene to 
a neurosciences unit being beneficial. 
A simulation model68 showed improved 
survival from directly transporting 
patients to a neurosciences hospital. 
However, a number of parameters were 
based on expert judgement rather than 
strong evidence.  A cost-effectiveness 
analysis based on this model showed 
that direct transport is likely to be costeffective. 
5.5.5 
Rationale behind recommendation 
There is no strong evidence to suggest a 
change in the previous recommendation 
(see bullet 5 within section 5.1). The 
GDG recognises that the transported 
patients with head injury directly to a 
neuroscience unit rather than a DGH 
would require a major shift of resources 
of between an additional 84,000 and 
105,000 bed days to neurosurgery from 
the existing general surgical, 
orthopaedic, emergency department, 
paediatric and geriatric services that 
currently care for these patients. The 
GDG recognize that further research is 
needed in this area in order to identify 
benefits in transporting patients with 
head injury to a neuroscience unit or a 
district general hospital. Therefore the 
GDG propose a research 
recommendation for this question (see 
section 5.5.7).",86,RIGHT,221,Page 86 (RIGHT)

5.5.6 
Recommendation 
[Amended] Patients who have 
sustained a head injury should be 
transported directly to a facility that 
has been identified as having the 
resources necessary to resuscitate, 
investigate and initially manage any 
patient with multiple injuries. It is 
expected that all acute hospitals and 
all neuroscience units accepting 
patients directly from an incident will 
have these resources, and that these 
resources will be appropriate for a 
patient’s age. (Same as the 
recommendation in section 5.1) 
5.5.7 
Recommendations for research 
The GDG identified the following 
priority area for research. 
5.5.7.1 
Research Question 
Is the clinical outcome of head injury 
patients with a reduced level of 
consciousness improved by direct 
transport from the scene of injury to a 
tertiary centre with neurosciences 
facilities compared with the outcome of 
those who are transported initially to the 
nearest hospital without neurosurgical 
facilities? 
The aim of this study is to conduct a 
comparison of patient outcomes 
(mortality/morbidity) for those head 
injured patients that are transported 
directly to a centre with neurosciences 
facilities with the outcomes of those who 
are transported to the nearest hospital 
without neurosciences facilities, possibly 
necessitating a secondary transfer. 
Patients suffering from serious head 
injuries with a reduced level of",87,LEFT,216,Page 87 (LEFT)
chunk_87_RIGHT,"consciousness are currently transported 
to the nearest hospital by land 
ambulance or helicopter. The nearest 
hospital may not have the resources or 
expertise to provide definitive care for 
these patients. Patients should be 
followed as they pass through the care 
system with mortality and morbidity 
outcomes collected. These should be 
compared to allow, using sub-group 
analysis, the identification of patients for 
whom direct transfer is most beneficial. 
5.5.7.2 
Why this research is important 
Limited evidence in this area has shown 
that patients do better in terms of 
outcome if they are transported directly 
to a neurosciences centre when 
compared to those who are taken to the 
nearest DGH. This evidence however 
does not appear to have influenced 
current practice. For people working in 
the prehospital arena, it is important to 
define which patients who have 
sustained a head injury would do better 
by being transported directly to a 
neurosciences centre. 
Currently patients are either always 
transported to the nearest DGH as is the 
case in most land vehicle deployment or 
in some organisations especially those 
involving helicopter emergency medical 
services the decision is left to the 
judgement of the clinicians at the scene. 
Those patients transported to the nearest 
DGH may suffer a significant delay in 
receiving definitive treatment for their 
head injury. Information from such 
research can help to define which 
patients should be transported direct to",87,RIGHT,228,Page 87 (RIGHT)
chunk_88_LEFT,"95
 
Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
a neurosciences centre bypassing the 
nearest hospital.  
Guidance will be required to define the 
patient population for example, 
researchers may focus on isolated 
injuries or head injuries associated with 
multi trauma. Further specification about 
what level of consciousness would be 
suitable for primary transfer to a 
neurosciences unit would be required. 
Researchers should look at the impact of 
the duration of transport on study 
outcome.  So for a journey time to the 
neurosciences unit of less than 20 
minutes, direct transport might improve 
outcomes, (as concluded by the London 
Severe Injury Working Group) but 
beyond this time, direct transport might 
worsen outcomes.   
5.6 
Advanced life support training for 
ambulance crews 
The value of advanced life support (ALS) 
training for ambulance crews over basic 
life support training (BLS) is 
controversial. ALS trained ambulance 
crews receive extra training in 
endotracheal intubation, intravenous 
cannulation, the administration of 
intravenous fluids and the use of 
selected drugs. A recent Cochrane 
systematic review concluded that 
insufficient evidence existed on the 
effectiveness of ALS training for 
ambulance crews.69 
Given this finding no change to current 
practice in ALS training for ambulance 
crews is recommended in these 
guidelines. This stance will be reviewed 
in forthcoming versions of these",88,LEFT,217,Page 88 (LEFT)
chunk_88_RIGHT,"guidelines depending on advances in the 
literature. 
5.7 
Priority dispatch of emergency 
ambulances 
The use of an emergency medical 
dispatch (EMD) system is controversial.  
The EMD system requires a form of 
telephone assessment carried out by 
ambulance dispatchers to determine the 
urgency of the emergency. A recent 
systematic review found little evidence 
on the effectiveness of EMD in terms of 
improved clinical outcomes.70 However, 
a recent study on the acceptability of 
EMD in a UK context found increased 
satisfaction among callers to the 999 
service. The amount of first aid advice 
and general information received by the 
service users increased while satisfaction 
with response times was maintained.71 
Given these findings no change to 
current practice in EMD is recommended 
in these guidelines. This stance will be 
reviewed in forthcoming versions of 
these guidelines depending on advances 
in the literature.",88,RIGHT,139,Page 88 (RIGHT)

full range of acute resuscitation 
procedures and who have all necessary 
equipment for resuscitation and 
monitoring.

care of head injured children  
x Direct access to 24 hour CT scanning

6.1 
Focus of emergency department 
assessment in patients with a head injury 
The main risk to patients who have 
sustained a recent head injury is the 
development of a clinically important 
brain injury. Some brain injuries require 
an early neurosurgical intervention (for 
example, intracranial haematoma 
requiring evacuation) but the life 
threatening nature of the injury makes 
early detection essential. Other clinically 
important brain injuries do not provide 
an immediate threat to the patient and 
may produce late sequelae. Early 
identification of these latter injuries may 
assist in rehabilitation. 
The main focus of emergency 
department assessment for patients",89,RIGHT,140,Page 89 (RIGHT)
chunk_90_LEFT,"97
 
Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
who have sustained a head injury 
should be the risk of clinically 
important brain injuries and injuries to 
the cervical spine and the consequent 
need for imaging. Due attention 
should also be paid to co-existing 
injuries and to other concerns the 
clinician may have (for example, nonaccidental injury, possible nontraumatic aetiology such as seizure). 
Early imaging, rather than admission 
and observation for neurological 
deterioration, will reduce the time to 
detection for life-threatening 
complications and is associated with 
better outcomes17,72. 
These recommendations are based on 
level five evidence and are considered 
to be grade D recommendations. 
6.2 
Investigation of clinically important brain 
injuries 
A systematic review of clinical decision 
rules for the selection of patients who 
have sustained a head injury for CT 
imaging of the head was carried out 
according to the methods outlined in 
Chapter Two. Six level one 
studies19,22,24,55,73,74 were identified. It 
was agreed that the review would focus 
on this evidence, but also give due 
cognisance to the findings of a level one 
systematic review examining the 
prognostic value of a diagnosis of ‘skull 
fracture’23 and a level two study that 
reported on the first part of a project 
likely to produce level one evidence.25 
The studies may be divided into 
contextual information and actual",90,LEFT,225,Page 90 (LEFT)
chunk_90_RIGHT,"decision rules. Four studies provide level 
one evidence on the following important 
contextual issues. First, skull X-ray is of 
limited value in assisting the diagnosis of 
ICH as the sensitivity of a positive 
finding is only 38%.23 While it is true 
that a finding of skull fracture on 
radiography significantly elevates the 
risk of ICH one cannot rule out ICH on 
the basis of a negative radiograph 
(sensitivity was 0.38, see section 1.5). 
Second, patients with a negative CT scan 
and no other body system injuries or 
persistent neurological findings can be 
safely discharged22. The negative 
predictive power quoted in this study 
was 99.7%. 
Third, a strategy of either 100% CT 
imaging or high quality in-patient 
observation for patients who have 
sustained a minor/mild head injury will 
be 100% sensitive.73,74The task is 
therefore to derive a more sophisticated 
clinical decision rule for patient selection 
that will improve specificity without 
impairing sensitivity. 
6.3 
What is the best initial diagnostic 
technique to determine which patients 
have sustained damage to the brain and 
require further assessment of the head? 
6.3.1 
Introduction and rationale for the 
clinical question 
In the 2003 guideline the GDG 
recommended CT imaging for the head 
as the primary investigation of choice 
for the detection of acute clinically 
important brain injuries (see 6.3.6). In 
this update a review was carried out to 
ascertain whether CT is still in 2007 the",90,RIGHT,230,Page 90 (RIGHT)
chunk_91_LEFT,"98
 
Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
most accurate tool for use in the initial 
diagnosis of head injury. This review 
also investigates whether there are other 
imaging tools that have been compared 
to CT and are accurate in identifying 
head injury. The outcome measures for 
including studies for this review were 
sensitivity and specificity of the imaging 
technique with or without mortality, 
disability, neurological outcome, hospital 
duration, and cost. 
6.3.2 
Clinical evidence  
In the earlier version of the head injury 
guideline no evidence was found that 
addressed this question. However in this 
update one study was retrieved75  in 
children and no evidence was retrieved 
for adults. This study75 examined the 
diagnostic value of physical examination 
(including neurological exam) for 
positive CT scan findings in 98 children 
(2-16 years) children with closed head 
injury. This prospective diagnostic study 
(level II evidence) evaluated physical 
examination using CT as the reference 
standard. This study was based in San 
Diego, USA. Halley et al conclude that 
physical examination cannot identify all 
cases of brain injury that are 
demonstrated on CT imaging. Physical 
examination was demonstrated in this 
study as having poor sensitivity of 0.69 
(CI: 0.42-0.87) and specificity of 0.4 (CI: 
0.30-0.51) for identifying patients with 
brain injury but this presupposes that CT 
is 100% accurate.

update 
The evidence is relatively weak as the 
Halley et al75 study  included a limited 
sample size with 9 out of the 98 subjects 
not being contactable.  
A decision model76 estimated that CT 
scanning all patients was more effective 
and cost saving than x-raying all 
patients. It also showed that selective CT 
scanning could be just as effective as 
routine CT with lower cost (see also 6.5). 
However, the setting was the USA where 
costs are quite different to the NHS and 
the estimates of effectiveness were 
derived from case series. 
6.3.5 
Rationale behind recommendation 
Generally speaking, CT is more sensitive 
than x-ray at detecting clinically 
important lesions, although evidence 
specific to head trauma was not 
retrieved.  CT is likely to be costeffective but only if a) the extra lesions 
found by CT pose a significant health 
risk, b) identification leads to 
earlier/better treatment and c) 
early/modified treatment improves 
survival.  For these variables there is no 
high quality evidence.  However, a 
decision model76 based on case series 
evidence estimated that CT scanning all 
patients would be more effective and 
cost saving than x-raying all patients in 
a US context.  
The GDG felt based on their expertise 
that CT is the most appropriate tool for 
diagnosing life-threatening conditions 
resulting from head injury. The GDG 
also felt that a recommendation was 
required to emphasize that x-ray is not",91,RIGHT,232,Page 91 (RIGHT)

a suitable substitute for CT. However, it 
was necessary to acknowledge that 
plain x-rays are useful adjuvant to CT in 
managing children with suspected nonaccidental injury and therefore a new 
recommendation was developed (see 
update 2007 recommendation).  
6.3.6 
Recommendation 
The current primary investigation of 
choice for the detection of acute 
clinically important brain injuries is CT 
imaging of the head. 
This recommendation is based on level 
one evidence and is considered to be a 
grade A recommendation. 
For safety, logistic and resource 
reasons, magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) scanning is not currently 
indicated as the primary investigation 
for clinically important brain injury in 
patients who have sustained a head 
injury, although it is recognised that 
additional information of importance 
to the patient’s prognosis can 
sometimes be detected using MRI.77  
MRI is contraindicated in both head 
and cervical spine investigations 
unless there is absolute certainty that 
the patient does not harbour an 
incompatible device, implant or 
foreign body.  
There should be appropriate 
equipment for maintaining and 
monitoring the patient within the MRI 
environment and all staff involved 
should be aware of the dangers and 
necessary precautions for working 
near an MRI scanner.  MRI safety,",92,LEFT,209,Page 92 (LEFT)
chunk_92_RIGHT,"availability and speed may improve in 
the future to the point where it becomes 
a realistic primary investigation option 
for head injury. 
These recommendations are based on 
level five evidence and are considered 
to be grade D recommendations. 
Update 2007 Recommendation- 
[NEW] Plain X-rays of the skull should 
not be used to diagnose significant 
brain injury without prior discussion 
with a neuroscience unit. However, 
they are useful as part of the skeletal 
survey in children presenting with 
suspected non-accidental injury.  
[NEW] Unless the CT result is required 
within 1 hour, it is acceptable to admit 
a patient for effective overnight 
observation and delay the CT scan 
until the next morning if the patient 
presents out of hours and any of the 
following risk factors are present in 
addition to a period of loss of 
consciousness or amnesia: 
- age 65 years or older 
- amnesia for events more than 30 
minutes before impact 
- dangerous mechanism of injury (a 
pedestrian or cyclist struck by a motor 
vehicle, an occupant ejected from a 
motor vehicle or a fall from a height of 
greater than 1 metre or five stairs).

observation. Arrangements should be 
in place for urgent transfer to a centre 
with CT scanning available should 
there be a clinical deterioration that 
indicates immediate CT scanning is 
necessary. 
6.4 
What are the effects on patient outcomes 
of providing an immediate CT versus 
observation? 
6.4.1 
Introduction and rationale for the 
clinical sub question 
A question that arises from identifying 
CT as the best initial imaging technique 
to determine which patients have 
sustained damage to the head and 
require care is whether providing an 
immediate CT yields better patient 
outcomes compared with observation. A 
review of the clinical evidence was 
deemed necessary as a sub-question as 
a part of the previous clinical question 
(see 6.3). 
6.4.2 
Clinical evidence  
One study (level 1++ evidence) was 
identified78 for this review. This recent 
large, randomised controlled trial78 
investigated CT compared with 
admission to hospital for observation. 
This study included hospital patients 
aged 6 years of age with mild head 
injury within the past 24hrs who 
attended emergency departments. The 
main findings from this trial were that at 
3 months, 21.4% (275/1316) of 
patients in the CT group had not 
recovered completely compared with 
24.2% (300/1286) admitted for 
observation. The difference was found",93,LEFT,215,Page 93 (LEFT)
chunk_93_RIGHT,"to be not significant in favour of CT 
(95%CI: -6.1%-0.6%). The worst 
outcomes like mortality and severe loss 
of function were similar between the 
groups. None of the patients with normal 
findings on immediate CT had 
complications later.  
6.4.3 
Economics Evidence from 2007 update 
See economic section chapter 11.3. 
6.4.4 
Summary of evidence from 2007 
update 
The Af Geijerstam study78 showed that 
the use of CT in the management of 
patients with mild head injury leads to 
similar clinical outcomes compared with 
observation in hospital. 
The associated economic evaluation79 
showed that for these mild head injured 
patients CT scanning and then discharge 
after a negative scan was cost saving 
compared with admission with no 
adverse effect on health outcome.   
6.5 
The best clinical prediction rule for 
selecting adults, infants and children with 
head injury for CT imaging of the head 
6.5.1 
Introduction and rationale for the 
clinical question 
In order to improve the efficiency of the 
management of minor head injury, 
clinical prediction rules can be applied. 
A clinical prediction rule is derived from 
original research and is defined as a 
decision making tool that incorporates 3 
or more variables from the history, 
examination or simple tests25,80,81. This 
review was carried out to examine which",93,RIGHT,205,Page 93 (RIGHT)
chunk_94_LEFT,"101
 
Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
clinical prediction rule was the best for 
selecting patients for CT imaging who 
had experienced a minor head injury. 
This question was deemed important as 
the current use of CT for minor head 
injury is increasing rapidly; it is highly 
variable and may be inefficient. The 
interventions included within this review 
were any prediction rule ranging from 
NEXUS, NOC, CHR and any other new 
rules. The studies were included if the 
outcomes included sensitivity and 
specificity of prediction rules. 
6.5.2 
Clinical evidence  
In the previous guideline, four studies 
discussed decision rules for selecting 
patients for CT imaging which attempted 
to identify those at a high risk for 
traumatic brain injury (usually 
ICH).19,24,25,55On examination of these 
studies it was felt that one study had 
validated the rules in a population with 
a much lower prevalence of abnormal 
CT scans than an average UK 
population24 and this study was not 
considered. A second study described a 
rule that had only a 65% sensitivity for 
abnormal CT scan results and was also 
not considered further.55 The sensitivity 
of these rules have been questioned in 
another study.82 
The remaining two sets of rules, the 
Canadian CT-rules25 and the ‘New 
Orleans’ criteria are now considered.19 
Two versions of the Canadian rules are 
available, a five point version designed 
to detect ‘need for neurological 
intervention’, and a seven point version 
designed to detect ‘clinically important 
brain injury’. The remit of this guideline is 
on the latter outcome, and the seven",94,LEFT,261,Page 94 (LEFT)
chunk_94_RIGHT,"point rule is therefore the focus of this 
review. However, it is recognised that 
the five point rule has some utility in 
determining the urgency with which CT 
imaging should be performed. 
Both papers present high quality 
evidence, but strictly the New Orleans 
criteria represents level one evidence as 
it has used separate samples for the 
derivation and validation phases. The 
Canadian rules represent level two 
evidence as they have not yet been 
validated in a separate sample (this 
study is ongoing and will report in 
2003). Both sets of authors caution 
against adoption of their rules, the 
Canadians because of the need for 
validation, and the New Orleans group 
because their rules were developed in 
one centre (the Canadian rules were 
developed in a multi-centre study). 
The Canadian sample25 for a derivation 
sample, was much larger with 3,121 
patients than the New Orleans sample19 
with 520 patients in the derivation 
phase and 909 patients in the validation 
phase. This led to statistical power 
problems with certain key variables (for 
example, coagulopathy) as not enough 
patients with these risk factors 
experienced a negative outcome. It 
should be noted that the Canadian study 
considered a much broader range of 
possible predictive variables, and has 
outlined in great detail the steps taken 
to ensure the validity and reliability of 
the data. Both studies used recursive 
partitioning as the multivariate technique 
used to derive the rules.",94,RIGHT,233,Page 94 (RIGHT)
chunk_95_LEFT,"102
 
Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
Both studies excluded patients who had 
experienced no loss of consciousness. The 
New Orleans study reports an overall 
abnormal CT rate of 6.5% and a 
surgical intervention rate of 0.4%, while 
the Canadian study reports a rate of 
clinically important brain injury of 8% 
and a neurosurgical intervention rate of 
1%. The Canadian study included only 
patients with an initial GCS on arrival at 
hospital of 13 to 15 and assumed that 
all patients with GCS less than 13 would 
receive immediate CT. Four per cent of 
patients in this study had an initial GCS 
of 13 and 17% had a GCS of 14, with 
the remaining 79% having a GCS of 15. 
The New Orleans study focused on 
patients with GCS equal to 15 in the 
emergency department (assuming that 
all patients with GCS less than 15 would 
receive immediate CT) and therefore 
had a lower severity sample than was 
seen in the Canadian sample. 
The cohort used for the derivation of the 
Canadian Head CT rule contained 69% 
males, 11% greater than or equal to 65 
years and 31% patients who had 
sustained a fall, similar to figures for the 
UK. However, as noted in section 1.8: 
cause of injury, the proportion of 
assaults seen in the Canadian sample 
(11%) is lower than is usually quoted for 
the UK (30-50%). By contrast, the 
proportion of road traffic accidents in 
the Canadian sample (43% if injuries 
involving pedestrians and cyclists are 
included) is higher than estimates of 
25% for the UK. It is not clear whether 
this reflects broad difference in injury 
patterns between the two countries, or 
simply reflects the specific group of 
patients selected for the Canadian study",95,LEFT,298,Page 95 (LEFT)
chunk_95_RIGHT,"(that is, hospital attendees that had 
experienced some loss of consciousness 
or amnesia). 
It is also important to note that the 
Guideline Development Group is under 
the impression that head injury episodes 
are more likely to involve alcohol in the 
UK than in Canada, although exact data 
on this variable is not available. 
Both studies report 100% sensitivity 
(95% CI: 92-100) for need for 
neurosurgical intervention. The New 
Orleans criteria reports a 100% (95% 
CI: 95-100) sensitivity for positive CT 
scans, whereas the Canadian seven point 
rules are 98% (95% CI: 96-99) sensitive 
for detecting clinically important brain 
injury. The New Orleans rules have a 
25% (95% CI: 22-28) specificity for 
detecting positive CT scans whereas the 
Canadian rules are reported to have a 
50% (95% CI: 48-51) specificity rate 
for detecting clinically important brain 
injury. 
The New Orleans criteria would lead to 
a 78% CT ordering rate in patients with 
GCS equal to 15. The Canadian seven 
point rules would lead to a 54% 
ordering rate in patients with a GCS of 
13 to 15. It is important to note that the 
New Orleans study reports 100% CTscanning of the sample, whereas the 
Canadian study had a scanning rate of 
only 67%, and the remaining 33% had 
a proxy outcome assessment via 
telephone interview. The final sample in 
the Canadian study does not include 
some 10% of eligible patients who did 
not undergo CT and subsequently could 
not be contacted for follow-up.",95,RIGHT,243,Page 95 (RIGHT)
chunk_96_LEFT,"103
 
Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
The rules have the following similarities. 
Both suggest that patients with GCS less 
than 15 on presentation at emergency 
departments should have immediate CT 
imaging. The only caveat to this is that 
the Canadian rules specify GCS less 
than 15 two hours after injury. However, 
it should be born in mind that 93% of 
adults and 96% of children report to 
emergency departments with GCS equal 
to 15,15 implying that CT imaging for 
those with GCS less than 15 will not 
greatly impact on resources. The area of 
controversy is generally accepted to 
relate to patients with GCS equal to 15. 
Neither rule suggests a role for skull Xray or admission for observation without 
CT imaging. Both rules agree that 
vomiting should be included as an 
indication for imaging, although the 
Canadian rule specifies more than one 
episode. Both rules agree that skull 
fracture (linear, basal, depressed, open, 
depressed and penetrating) should be 
an indication for CT imaging but these 
are defined and dealt with in different 
ways. In the New Orleans rules this is 
included as part of a category named 
‘physical evidence of trauma above the 
clavicles’ which also includes contusions, 
abrasions and lacerations. Presumably 
these would include facial surface 
wounds and not only wounds to the skull. 
The Canadian rules seem to have 
considered obvious penetrating skull 
injury and/or obvious depressed skull 
fracture as a priori indications for 
imaging and have also included any sign 
of basal skull fracture, and any 
‘suspicion’ of open or depressed skull 
fracture as part of their rules.",96,LEFT,273,Page 96 (LEFT)
chunk_96_RIGHT,"Both rules include an age category. The 
New Orleans rules specify age greater 
than 60 years, and the Canadian rules 
specify age greater than or equal to 65 
years. 
Both rules agree that post-traumatic 
seizure should be an indication for CT 
imaging, but the Canadian rules 
considered this an a priori variable, 
whereas it is explicitly included in the 
New Orleans rules. 
It is also important to note that 
coagulopathy is not included in either set 
of rules but for very different reasons. 
The Canadian study excluded these 
patients deliberately, presumably 
because they were considered a priori 
candidates for CT imaging. The New 
Orleans rules included these patients but 
did not have enough power to detect a 
significant predictive effect. The New 
Orleans study explicitly states that this 
variable was not considered by their 
study and imply that it should be 
considered an important predictive 
variable. A further exclusion from both 
samples is focal neurological deficit (this 
is not completely clear from the New 
Orleans study) again, presumably 
because CT imaging of the head for 
these patients was considered noncontroversial. 
The rules differ in their treatment of 
amnesia. The Canadian rules include 
pre-traumatic amnesia (retrograde – for 
events before the injury) of greater than 
30 minutes, whereas the New Orleans 
rules include post-traumatic ‘short-term 
memory deficits’ (anterograde - for 
events after the injury). The Canadian",96,RIGHT,225,Page 96 (RIGHT)

Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
rules contain a variable called 
‘dangerous mechanism’ (of injury), which 
is defined as a pedestrian struck by a 
motor vehicle, an occupant ejected from 
a motor vehicle or a fall from a height 
of greater than three feet or five stairs. 
The New Orleans rules did not consider 
this variable. The New Orleans rules 
contain a headache variable, which was 
dropped from the Canadian rules. 
The New Orleans rules contain a 
variable for drug or alcohol intoxication 
whereas this is not included in the 
Canadian rules. The Canadian authors 
seem to imply that having a variable 
""GCS less than 15 after 2 hours"" will 
allow the less severe intoxications to 
resolve and eliminate a corresponding 
number of unnecessary scans. The 
Canadian authors measured ethanol 
levels in a sub-sample and found that it 
had no predictive power for the 
outcomes studied. 
UPDATE 2007: Adult rules 
Three new studies81,83,84 were retrieved 
for this review looking at clinical 
prediction rules in adults in addition to 
the studies in the previous guidleline (see 
section 6.5.2).  
One of the 3 new studies looking at 
clinical prediction rules in adults was 
Stiell et al81, a prospective cohort 
validation study (diagnostic study level I 
evidence) of 1822 blunt head trauma 
patients in nine Canadian emergency 
departments. In the previous guideline 
the derivation study was included. The 
inclusion criteria were defined as blunt 
trauma to the head resulting in witnessed",97,LEFT,249,Page 97 (LEFT)
chunk_97_RIGHT,"loss of consciousness, definite amnesia or 
witnessed disorientation, a GCS score of 
13 or greater and injury within the 
previous 24 hours. The Canadian CT 
head rule (CCHR) was compared to the 
New Orleans Criteria (NOC). There 
were 97 patients (5.3%) with clinically 
important brain injury and 8 patients 
(0.4%) required neurosurgical 
intervention. For detecting clinically 
important brain injury both rules had 
100% (95% CI, 96% to 100%) 
sensitivity but the Canadian CT head 
rule had a higher specificity of 50.6% 
(95% CI, 48%to 53%) than NOC 12.7% 
(95% CI, 11% to 14%). The reference 
standard was the CT scan. 
The second study was a prospective 
cohort study (diagnostic study level II 
evidence) by Smits et al84 comprising 
3181 Dutch patients with blunt head 
injury and compared the NOC and 
CCHR rules. The inclusion criteria were 
patients age older than 16 years, GCS 
of 13 to 14 and presentation within 24 
hours. Patients with a GCS score of 15 
were included if they had one of the 
following risk factors; history of loss of 
consciousness, short-term memory deficit, 
amnesia for traumatic event, 
posttraumatic seizure, vomiting, severe 
headache, clinical evidence of 
intoxication, use of anticoagulants, 
physical evidence of injury above 
clavicles or neurological deficit.  
The prevalence of neurocranial 
traumatic CT findings was 9.8% and the 
incidence of neurosurgical intervention 
was 0.5%. The CT scan was used as the 
reference standard. For neurosurgical 
intervention both rules had 100% (95%",97,RIGHT,237,Page 97 (RIGHT)

CI, 81.6 to 100%) sensitivity and the 
CCHR had a higher specificity of 37.5% 
(95% CI, 34.9% to 40.0%) compared to 
NOC 3.0% (95% CI, 1.2% to 4.8%). 
Neurocranial traumatic CT findings and 
important CT findings reported a higher 
sensitivity for the NOC rule. Outcomes 
were also reported on the entire 
population, which resulted in the authors 
adapting the rules to their study 
population. This study has 
methodological concerns as the rules 
tested were adapted to fit into their 
study population.  
The final study83 was a prospective 
cohort derivation study (diagnostic study 
level II evidence) for the NEXUS II rules 
by Mower et al which has not yet been 
validated in a separate sample. This 
study comprised 13,728 blunt trauma 
patients in 21 participating centres who 
had undergone a head CT scan. The 
prevalence of intracranial injury was 
6.7% (917 out of 13,728). The 
prediction rule had 8 criteria highly 
associated with intracranial injuries. The 
rule had a sensitivity of 98.3% (95% CI, 
97.2% to 99.0%) and specificity of 
13.7% (95% CI, 13.1% to 14.3%).  
UPDATE 2007: Child rules 
Four new studies in children53,85-87 were 
retrieved in this update.  
Oman at el85 studied a prospective 
cohort (diagnostic study level II 
evidence) of 1666 children (under 18 
years) with blunt head trauma. Patients 
underwent CT scanning from 21 
emergency departments in the NEXUS 
cohort. This study looked at children in",98,LEFT,246,Page 98 (LEFT)
chunk_98_RIGHT,"the NEXUS II derivation study to 
determine if the prediction rule was 
effective on children. The prevalence of 
clinically important ICI was 8.3%. The 
sensitivity was 98.6% (95% CI, 94.999.8) and the specificity 15.1% (95% 
CI, 13.3-16.9). When the sub-group of 
children under 3 years old was 
examined the sensitivity was 100% 
(95% CI, 86.3-100). 
The second prospective cohort study 
(diagnostic study level I evidence) by 
Haydel et al86 comprised 175 children 
(5-17 years) with minor head injury from 
trauma centre in US. Minor head injury 
was defined as blunt head trauma with 
loss of consciousness and a normal GCS 
score, or modified coma scale for infants 
and children and normal brief 
neurological examination. The reference 
standard was a CT scan. The NOC 
prediction rule was applied to the 
population to determine children with 
intracranial injury. The prevalence was 
8%. The sensitivity was 100% (95% CI, 
73-100) and the specificity was 25.5% 
(95% CI, 19.1-33.0%). The CT ordering 
rate was reduced by 23.4% (95% CI, 
17.7-30.2).  
Palchak87 reported a prospective cohort 
study (diagnostic study level II evidence) 
of 2,043 children (under 18 years) 
presenting with blunt head trauma of all 
severities at a paediatric emergency 
department at a level 1 trauma centre. 
Significant predictors of traumatic brain 
injury were determined and the 
prediction rule was derived using 
recursive partitioning. The reference 
standard was CT scanning and clinical 
follow-up. The prediction rule had a",98,RIGHT,233,Page 98 (RIGHT)

sensitivity of 100% (95% CI, 97.2% to

CI, 40.5% to 44.9%) to identify 
traumatic brain injury requiring 
intervention. The prediction rule was 
used on the sub-group of patients that 
had a CT scan (n=1271) to identify 
traumatic brain injury identified on CT. 
The sensitivity was 99.0% (95% CI 
94.4% to 100%) and specificity 25.8% 
(95% CI 23.3% to 28.4%). This 
prediction rule missed one patient with a 
traumatic brain injury identified on CT. 
This is a derivation study, not yet 
validated.  
Palchak prediction rule: 
A CT scan is required if any of the 
following predictors are present: 
• Abnormal mental status 
• Clinical signs of skull fracture 
• History of vomiting 
• Scalp haematoma in children aged 2 
years or younger 
• Headache 
The final study by Dunning53 which is a 
prospective multi-centre cohort 
(diagnostic study level II evidence) 
reported 22,772 children (under 16 
years) presenting at ten hospital 
emergency departments in  the North 
West of England with any severity of

determined and the Children’s Head

The reference standard was CT scanning 
and clinical follow-up by a multi-modal

of 98.6% (95% CI, 96.4% to 99.6%) 
and a specificity of 86.9% (95% CI,

Summary of evidence from 2007 
update 
Adult Rule  
Three new studies81,83,84 were identified 
for this review which compared different 
decision rules in adults. One study81 
showed that for patients with minor head 
injury and GCS score of 15, the 
Canadian CT head rule had a higher 
specificity than NOC for clinical 
important outcomes. This study also 
showed that the Canadian CT head rule 
and NOC have equivalent high 
sensitivities for detecting the need for 
neurosurgical intervention and clinically 
important brain injury. The second 
study84 showed that for patients with 
minor head injury and a GCS score of 
13 to 15, the Canadian CT head rule 
has a lower sensitivity than the NOC for 
neurocranial traumatic or clinically 
important CT findings. The final study83 
included the NEXUS II rule which had a 
sensitivity of 98.3% and specificity of 
13.7%. 
When we updated the unit costs in the 
guideline’s cost analysis, the results were 
even more favourable towards the 
Canadian head CT rule, since radiology 
costs had fallen. Two studies16,88 of the 
impact of our recommendation for head 
imaging showed opposite results; there 
is still great uncertainty about the rates 
of imaging and admission nationally and 
therefore the overall economic impact of 
the guideline is unclear. A published 
economic evaluation76 using cohort study 
evidence suggested that the Canadian 
head CT rule is more cost-effective in a 
US context than a number of alternative 
strategies based on CT, X-ray or",100,RIGHT,238,Page 100 (RIGHT)

admission. However, none of the 
economic evidence has taken into 
account the impact of the increased 
radiation exposure.   
Child Rules 
The 4 new studies53,85-87 within this 
review compared different decision rules 
in children. One study85 concluded that 
the decision rule derived in the large 
NEXUS II cohort performed with similar 
high sensitivity among the subgroup of 
children who were included in this study. 
The second study86 found that CT use in 
children aged 5 years or older with 
minor head injury could be safely 
reduced by 23% by using a clinical 
decision rule previously validated in 
adults. The Palchak study87 derived a 
clinical decision rule for the identification 
of children who should undergo CT after 
head injury. The final study53 derived a 
highly sensitive clinical decision rule for 
the identification of children who should 
undergo CT scanning after head injury. 
We did not find any economic evidence 
specific to children. 
6.5.5 
Rationale behind recommendation 
Two evidence based decision rules for 
selection of patients who have sustained 
a head injury for CT imaging of the 
head have been described.  There is no 
clear means of choosing one over the 
other, and the decision on which rule to 
choose was therefore based on 
consensus. Based on the Guideline 
Development Group consensus, it was 
decided that the seven point Canadian 
CT head rules should be used to identify",101,LEFT,242,Page 101 (LEFT)
chunk_101_RIGHT,"patients who will need CT imaging of the 
head. 
In order to provide guidance that covers 
all possibilities, the seven point 
Canadian CT rule has been slightly 
adapted as follows. 
x Patients with post-traumatic seizure, 
focal neurological deficit or 
coagulopathy should be included in the 
x Patients with non-symptomatic risk 
factors (that is, age greater than or 
equal to 65 years, coagulopathy, 
dangerous mechanism of injury) should 
at least have had an instance of loss of 
consciousness or amnesia (that is, the 
main signs and symptoms used to screen 
patients for inclusion in the Canadian 
CT-head rule study) before receiving CT. 
This is to prevent the possibility of 
patients with no signs or symptoms 
receiving a CT. 
x As noted above, falls from three feet 
have been changed to falls from 
greater than 1 metre, to ensure 
consistency with other rules adopted by 
this guideline. A lower threshold for 
height of falls should be used when 
dealing with infants and young children 
(that is, aged under 5 years). See 
section 4.8. 
x Clinical judgement regarding the 
cause of vomiting in those aged under or 
equal to 12 years should be used, and 
this judgement should guide whether 
imaging is considered necessary.",101,RIGHT,201,Page 101 (RIGHT)
chunk_102_LEFT,"109
 
Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
x The assessment of amnesia will not be 
possible in pre-verbal children and is 
unlikely to be possible in any child aged 
under 5 years. 
The 2003 Guideline Development 
Group considered these 
recommendations see below to be 
interim and dependant on future 
research which was likely to appear in 
the literature in time for the update. 
These include the validation phase of the 
Canadian CT head rules, and a new 
clinical decision instrument based upon 
the NEXUS II study. The latter study 
recruited approximately 15,000 
patients to the overall project 
(derivation and validation)89.  
In relation to selection of patients for 
imaging of the head, a recent level two 
study has produced a clinical decision 
rule for use in children aged under 2 
years. It is likely that a validation study 
for this rule will appear in the near 
future, although methodological concerns 
will remain about the derivation phase 
(see Appendix i). A strong predictive 
power is ascribed to scalp haematoma 
in young children.90 
The literature on skull X-ray in children 
and infants indicates that, as with adults, 
the specificity of skull X-ray is too low to 
be the primary investigation (that is, the 
absence of skull fracture does not 
predict absence of intra-cranial 
complications).20,91,92 In studies which 
have included both children and adults, 
there is evidence that adult rules can be 
safely applied to children, but these 
studies have suffered from statistical 
power problems.93 The evidence",102,LEFT,253,Page 102 (LEFT)
chunk_102_RIGHT,"regarding the safety of adult rules with 
infants is inconclusive.19,24,55 
UPDATE 2007: Adult rules 
Based on the three adult prediction rule 
studies81,83,84, the GDG decided that no 
change in recommendation was required 
as they felt there was not enough 
evidence to warrant a change. The case 
for selective CT scanning was 
strengthened by a cost-effectiveness 
model, although it was conducted from a 
US perspective and the UK evidence 
showed great variability between 
centres. One study had drawn attention 
to difficulties in scanning and 
discharging patients out of hours16, in 
particular, it is often not practical to 
discharge elderly patients during the 
night for social reasons. The GDG 
agreed that patients age 65 years or 
older presenting out of hours who are 
fully conscious and have no other 
indication for an immediate CT can be 
safely managed by admission for 
overnight observation without immediate 
CT. Admitting these patients overnight 
could be cheaper than out of hours CT 
scanning, especially as it would not be 
possible to discharge many of these 
patients. Furthermore the Af Geijerstam 
study showed that for head injured 
patients generally, observation was not 
associated with a significant increase in 
morbidity or mortality compared with 
immediate CT (see 6.4). The GDG also 
recognize that any centre which receives 
head injured patients should have 24 
hour CT scanner availability however 
there may be situations where due to 
failure of CT scanning equipment this 
may not be possible. It is then important",102,RIGHT,241,Page 102 (RIGHT)
chunk_103_LEFT,"110
 
Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
to make sure that patients are 
transferred to a centre which does have 
the relevant equipment (see 
recommendation 6.5.6). 
UPDATE 2007: Child rules 
The original recommendation stated that 
validated adult rules (Canadian head 
CT rule) on imaging of the head may be 
safely used in children and infants. 
However, the GDG decided that a new 
recommendation was required for 
clinical prediction rules of the head in 
children with the emerging evidence in 
the Dunning study in this update 
(CHALICE)53.  
The CT ordering rates for both rules are 
similar53 and therefore the rule that is 
most accurate is likely to be the most 
cost-effective.   
 The GDG considers that the CHALICE 
rule for children is derived from the best 
current evidence for the treatment of 
head injuries in children, but the GDG 
cautions that this rule is a derivation 
study only and requires prospective 
validation. Therefore future 
recommendations will be dependent on 
future validation studies.

Recommendation 
For Adults - 
[Amended] Adult patients who have 
sustained a head injury and present 
with any one of the following risk 
factors should have CT scanning of the 
head requested immediately:",103,LEFT,203,Page 103 (LEFT)

assessment in the emergency 
department. 
- GCS less than 15 at 2 hours after the 
injury on assessment in the emergency 
department. 
- Suspected open or depressed skull 
fracture.

For Children - 
 [NEW] Children (under 16 years) who 
have sustained a head injury and 
present with any one of the following 
risk factors should have CT scanning 
of the head requested immediately: 
- Loss of consciousness lasting more 
than 5 minutes (witnessed). 
- Amnesia (antegrade or retrograde)

- If under 1 year, presence of bruise, 
swelling or laceration of more than 5 
cm on the head.

as pedestrian, cyclist or vehicle 
occupant, fall from a height of greater",104,LEFT,210,Page 104 (LEFT)
chunk_104_RIGHT,"than 3 metres, high-speed injury from 
a projectile or an object).   
6.6 
Investigation of cervical spine injuries 
Patients who have sustained head injury 
may have co-incidental cervical spine 
injury. These patients require clinical and 
radiographic clearance of the cervical 
spine before removal of an 
immobilisation device. The major 
consequence of a missed bony or 
ligamentous injury is damage to the 
cervical cord. 
6.6.1 
Imaging options 
There are four options for imaging of 
the cervical spine. It is recognised that 
technological advances in imaging 
modalities may make the following 
discussion obsolete in the future. 
x Plain films: 
o cross table lateral 
o 3 film series (with swimmer’s view for 
cervico-dorsal junction if required) 
o 5 film series including ‘trauma 
obliques’. 
x Lateral flexion/extension series – 
immediate and/or delayed. 
x CT 
 (localised or whole cervical 
spine including cervico-dorsal junction). 
x Magnetic Resonance Imaging. 
6.6.1.1 Plain films 
When adequate visualisation of the 
entire cervical spine is achieved a 
negative predictive value for a  three-",104,RIGHT,161,Page 104 (RIGHT)
chunk_105_LEFT,"112
 
Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
view series has been quoted as between 
93-98%.94-96Sensitivity however varies 
from 62% to 84% in these high risk 
populations. It is estimated that in a high 
risk population one in six cervical spine 
injuries would be missed relying on an 
adequate three-view plain film series 
alone.97 If fractures that are clinically 
important are used as the gold standard 
then sensitivity is approximately 94%98 
and overall specificity 96% in a low risk 
group.99 
There is evidence that five-view cervical 
spine radiography does not improve 
predictive value compared to three-view 
radiography with CT as the gold 
standard.100 The use of a lateral view 
alone will miss a significant proportion 
of injuries detected by a three-view 
series.101 
Patients who have sustained major 
trauma are more difficult to evaluate 
with plain films and specificity decreases 
to between 79% and 89%, mainly due 
to inadequate or incomplete studies. The 
most common reason for this is poor 
visualisation of the cervico-dorsal 
junction. 
6.6.1.2 
Lateral flexion/extension views 
In alert symptomatic patients, lateral 
flexion/extension views can be safely 
performed over the pain-free range. 
Studies have shown significant false 
positive and false negative rates.102 Ten 
per cent of ‘normals’ may have 
‘abnormal’ flexion/extension views.103 
There is controversy over the safety of 
using fluoroscopically guided passive",105,LEFT,223,Page 105 (LEFT)
chunk_105_RIGHT,"flexion and extension to assess patients 
who are not fully conscious.  
6.6.1.3 
CT imaging of the cervical spine 
CT imaging of the cervical spine may be 
localised (for example, craniocervical or 
cervico-dorsal to clarify a clinical or 
plain radiographic area of suspicion), or 
cover the whole cervical spine. Modern 
multislice helical CT scanners enable the 
whole cervical spine to be scanned at 
high resolution with ease.  Multiplanar 
reformatted images can be generated 
rapidly on modern workstations. Use of 
these modern facilities is increasing in 
the NHS, but total coverage has not yet 
been achieved. 
Several studies report 100% sensitivity 
for detection of injuries in areas poorly 
visualised or suspicious on plain films. 
These studies are flawed however in 
that they have not used an alternative 
gold standard.97 If CT imaging of the 
head has been requested the cost of 
cervical CT is reduced and can be 
accomplished quickly without patient 
transfer. 
6.6.1.4 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of 
the cervical spine 
There is evidence that MRI detects a 
higher proportion of soft tissue 
abnormalities when performed within 48 
hours of injury than plain film and CT104 
but the clinical significance of these 
injuries is unclear.  MRI is less effective 
than CT in the detection of bony 
injury.105 It has also been demonstrated 
that MRI can miss ligamentous injuries if 
delayed.106 Injuries of the mid-cervical 
spine, especially subluxation and lateral",105,RIGHT,228,Page 105 (RIGHT)

fractures are associated with vertebral 
artery injury which may be detected by 
MRI.107 
6.6.1.5 Occipital condyle injuries 
Occipital condylar fractures are 
uncommon injuries associated with high 
energy blunt trauma to the head and/or 
upper cervical spine. They are difficult 
to diagnose clinically but should be 
suspected in patients showing signs of 
lower cranial nerve palsy after injury. 
Demonstration on plain films is extremely 
difficult and radiological diagnosis 
requires good quality CT. 
6.7 
What is the best diagnostic imaging 
technique to determine which patients 
have sustained damage to the cervical 
spine and require further assessment of 
cervical spine 
6.7.1 
Introduction and rationale for the 
clinical question 
Given the potentially devastating 
consequences of a missed cervical spine 
injury, timely and accurate diagnosis is 
essential for optimal management. This 
review is required to identify which of 
the currently available tools is best to 
identify clinically important cervical 
spine injury.  
The population group was patients with 
head injury and suspected cervical spine 
injury. The intervention/imaging options 
were: 
x Computed Tomography Scan (CT) 
x Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)",106,LEFT,190,Page 106 (LEFT)
chunk_106_RIGHT,"x X-rays: cross table lateral, 3 film 
series, 5 film series, lateral flexion; 
extension series or swimmer views 
x Observation alone 
x Physical examination 
The outcome measures for included 
studies for this review were sensitivity 
and specificity of the imaging technique. 
6.7.2 
Clinical evidence  
We included one meta-analysis108 which 
compared plain X-rays with CT. This 
meta-analysis included seven diagnostic 
cohort studies. The studies varied in the 
number of views (3 and 5) and some 
were retrospective and others 
prospective. Another prospective 
diagnostic cohort study109 was also 
retrieved comparing 3 view X-ray with 
CT. The final prospective diagnostic 
cohort study110 compared helical CT and 
X-rays (single cross-table lateral). All 3 
studies were graded as diagnostic 
studies level II evidence. All these studies 
included patients over 16 years of age. 
We found no studies in children and 
infants. 
A meta-analysis108 was retrieved which 
included seven diagnostic cohort studies. 
This study comprised 3834 patients with 
blunt trauma events requiring imaging. 
The reference standard was either CT or 
all imaging scans and clinical follow-up. 
CT scans had a higher sensitivity of 98% 
(95% CI, 96-99) compared to X-rays 
which were 52% (95% CI, 47-56). The 
test for heterogeneity for the sensitivity 
of CT was 0.99 and for X-rays was 
0.07. As there was a high variation in",106,RIGHT,213,Page 106 (RIGHT)

Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
the sensitivities for X-rays we reviewed 
the seven studies95,111-116 individually. 
The patient populations varied between 
the studies. Three studies95,112,115 
selected only the most severely injured 
patients (altered mental status or those 
requiring admission to the intensive care 
unit). One study116 selected only high risk 
blunt trauma patients. Another study’s113 
inclusion criteria was for blunt trauma 
patients with physical findings of 
posterior midline neck tenderness, 
altered mental status or neurological 
deficit. The final two studies111,114 
reviewed patients that had suffered a 
cervical spine fracture or patients that 
had both CT and X-ray imaging for 
suspected cervical spine fracture. The 
later study111 reported a prevalence of 
cervical spine injury of 76% (19 of 25 
included patients).  The sensitivities in 
these seven studies ranged from 39 to 
76%. The studies varied in the number 
of X-ray views (3 and 5) and three were 
retrospective and four prospective. The 
meta-analysis108 evidence supports the 
use of cervical spine CT as the initial 
screening test in high risk patients.  
A prospective cohort study109 was 
retrieved. This was a small study (N=34) 
that selected high risk blunt trauma 
patients in a US trauma centre. The 
study used X-rays to identify fractures 
of the cervical spine and CT scans were 
used as the reference standard. The 
sensitivity of X-rays (3 view) was 93.3% 
and the specificity was 95.0%.  
The final prospective cohort study110 
comprised 442 unconscious intubated 
blunt trauma patients in the UK. The 
reference standard was MRI and/or",107,LEFT,258,Page 107 (LEFT)
chunk_107_RIGHT,"clinical outcome. The interventions tested 
were helical CT (n=381) and X-rays 
(single cross-table lateral) (n=421). 
Only 421 patients had a cross table 
lateral film as 21 patients went straight 
to CT for clinical reasons. 381 patients 
had a CT scan that was followed up by 
MRI or clinical outcome. Cervical spine 
injuries were found in 14% of the 
patients. CT scans were more sensitive 
than X-rays (98.1% vs 72.1% 
respectively). X-rays had a lower 
specificity (94.2%) than CT scans 
(98.8%). Only 200 of the X-rays were 
adequate.  
6.7.3 
Economics Evidence from 2007 update 
See Economics section in chapter 11.4 
6.7.4 
Summary of evidence from 2007 
update 
The meta-analsyis108 found that CT had 
a higher sensitivity than X-rays. 
Nygren109 found that X-rays had a 
sensitivity of 93.3% in high risk blunt 
trauma patients (CT was used as the 
reference standard). Brohi et al110 found 
that CT scans had a higher sensitivity 
than X-rays in a group of unconscious 
intubated blunt trauma patients.  
The economic evidence117-120 suggests 
that CT scanning of the cervical spine is 
cost-effective in higher risk groups who 
are already undergoing head CT. 
However, the costs and health 
consequences associated with the 
increased radiation exposure were not 
taken into account, and the settings of 
these studies were outside the UK NHS.",107,RIGHT,212,Page 107 (RIGHT)
chunk_108_LEFT,"115
 
Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
6.7.5 
Rationale behind recommendation 
There is no evidence at present to 
suggest that cervical spine CT scanning is 
required for everyone regardless of 
head injury severity; the economic 
evidence suggests that it would not be 
cost-effective for head injury patients 
with a low risk of spinal damage. The 
GDG previously recommended that Xrays should be the initial imaging 
modality of choice supplemented with CT 
when appropriate.   
The new evidence108-110 indicates that in 
severely head injured patients, CT is the 
best initial diagnostic tool for assessment 
of the cervical spine.The GDG suggested 
a change in wording of the 
recommendation to add that patients 
with head injury (GCS  13) and 
intubated patients should have CT scans 
of the cervical spine rather than plain 
radiographs.  
If CT detects more unstable fractures 
then potentially it will lead to health 
gain and cost savings by averting 
paralysis. The cost-effectiveness 
evidence117-121 suggests that CT scanning 
of the cervical spine is cost-effective in 
higher risk groups but not in all head 
injured patients. These studies were 
conducted from a US perspective and 
therefore are not directly applicable to 
the UK NHS. Logically, as long as CT is 
picking up more unstable fractures, 
cervical spine CT will be cost-effective 
for those NHS patients at the very 
highest risk; the threshold at which it 
becomes not cost-effective is, however, 
difficult to determine.",108,LEFT,241,Page 108 (LEFT)
chunk_108_RIGHT,"The rationale for this amendment to the 
previous recommendation is that in this 
group of head injured patients (GCS  
13) X-rays are not able to detect all 
cervical spine injuries and the risk of 
cervical spine injury is higher than in the 
less severely head injured patients. The 
update evidence is level two evidence. 
The recommendation is based on the 
evidence retrieved along with the GDG 
consensus. The GDG agreed that this 
change to the recommendation could 
also be applied for children as there is 
no evidence at present to suggest 
otherwise. 
6.7.6 
Recommendation 
[Amended] The current initial 
investigation of choice for the 
detection of injuries to the cervical 
spine is the plain radiograph. Three 
views should be obtained and be of 
sufficient quality for reliable 
interpretation. However, in certain 
circumstances CT is preferred.  
[NEW] Adult patients who have any of 
the following risk factors should have 
CT imaging of the cervical spine 
requested immediately: 
- GCS below 13 on initial assessment 
- Has been intubated 
- Plain film series is technically 
inadequate (for example, desired view 
unavailable), suspicious or definitely 
abnormal  
- Continued clinical suspicion of injury 
despite a normal X ray. 
- The patient is being scanned for 
multi-region trauma.",108,RIGHT,203,Page 108 (RIGHT)
chunk_109_LEFT,"116
 
Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
As a minimum, CT should cover any 
areas of concern or uncertainty on 
plain film or clinical grounds.  
With modern multislice scanners the 
whole cervical spine can be scanned 
at high resolution with ease and 
multiplanar reformatted images 
generated rapidly. Facilities for 
multiplanar reformatting and 
interactive viewing should be 
available. 
MRI is indicated in the presence of 
neurological signs and symptoms 
referable to the cervical spine and if 
there is suspicion of vascular injury 
(for example, subluxation or 
displacement of the spinal column, 
fracture through foramen 
transversarium or lateral processes, 
posterior circulation syndromes).  
MRI may add important information 
about soft tissue injuries associated 
with bony injuries demonstrated by 
plain films and/or CT.  
MRI has a role in the assessment of 
ligamentous and disc injuries 
suggested by plain films, CT or clinical 
findings. 
In CT, the occipital condyle region 
should be routinely reviewed on 'bone 
windows' for patients who sustained a 
head injury.  Reconstruction of 
standard head images onto a high 
resolution bony algorithm is readily 
achieved with modern CT scanners. 
In patients who have sustained high 
energy trauma or are showing signs of 
lower cranial nerve palsy, particular",109,LEFT,205,Page 109 (LEFT)
chunk_109_RIGHT,"attention should be paid to the region 
of the foramen magnum. If necessary, 
additional high resolution imaging for 
coronal and sagittal reformatting 
should be performed while the patient 
is on the scanner table. 
These recommendations are based on 
level three evidence and are 
considered to be grade B 
recommendations.  
6.8 
Cervical spine imaging of Infants and 
children 
6.8.1 
Recommendation 
Children aged 10 years or more can be 
treated as adults for the purposes of 
cervical spine imaging.  
It is recognised that physical 
examination of an immobilised, 
distressed child can be extremely 
difficult. Based on consensus the 
following recommendations were 
formulated by the Guideline 
Development Group: 
Children under 10 years should 
receive anterior/posterior and lateral 
plain films without an 
anterior/posterior peg view.  
This recommendation is based on level 
five evidence and is considered to be a 
grade D recommendation. 
[NEW] In children under 10 years, 
because of the increased risks 
associated with irradiation, 
particularly to the thyroid gland, and 
the generally lower risk of significant 
spinal injury, CT of the cervical spine

patients have a severe head injury 
(GCS  8), or where there is a strong 
clinical suspicion of injury despite 
normal plain films (for example, focal 
neurological signs or paraesthesia in 
the extremities), or where plain films 
are technically difficult or inadequate. 
This recommendation is based on GDG 
opinion and evidence on risks of 
irradiation (see 10).  
6.9 
The best clinical prediction rule for 
selecting patients that have sustained 
damage to the cervical spine for the 
imaging technique selected in section 6.7? 
6.9.1 
Introduction and rationale for the 
clinical question 
In order to improve the efficiency of the 
management of cervical spine injury, 
clinical prediction rules can be applied. 
A clinical prediction rule is derived from 
original research and is defined as a 
decisional making tool that incorporates 
three or more variables from the history, 
examination or simple tests25,80,81. This 
review was carried out to examine which 
clinical prediction rule was the best for 
determining which patients should 
undergo CT of the cervical spine. This 
question was deemed important as 
emerging evidence shows that the 
current practice of using plain films is not 
always reliable in identifying clinically 
important injuries to the cervical spine. 
This is particularly true in patients with 
severe head injury in whom assessment is 
more difficult. The interventions included 
within the studies were any prediction 
rule ranging from NEXUS, NOC, CCR 
and any other new rules. The outcomes",110,LEFT,249,Page 110 (LEFT)
chunk_110_RIGHT,"included sensitivity and specificity of 
prediction rules. 
6.9.2 
Clinical evidence  
In the 2003 guideline, a systematic 
review of clinical decision rules for 
selection of patients who sustained a 
head injury for imaging of the cervical 
spine was carried out according to the 
methods outlined in Chapter Two. Two 
level one studies were identified.52,122 
These were the NEXUS study group from 
America and the Canadian cervical 
spine rule. 
The remaining papers that were 
reviewed all contained non-level one 
evidence for a variety of rules and were 
derived in small cohorts. In addition 
some papers considered a variety of 
different aspects of cervical spine 
imaging. These included studies in 
patients who are not fully conscious, 
studies on the utility of flexion-extension 
views, studies in children and studies on 
the utility of CT scanning or MRI 
scanning. These studies are included in 
the evidence table but contribute little to 
the decision as to which rule to use to 
exclude low risk patients from cervical 
imaging. 
The Canadian cervical spine rule 
involves the following questions. 
x Is there any high risk factor present 
that mandates radiography: age 
greater than or equal to 65 years, 
dangerous mechanism, or paraesthesia 
in the extremities? 
x Is there a low risk factor present that 
allows the safe assessment of range of",110,RIGHT,213,Page 110 (RIGHT)
chunk_111_LEFT,"118

motion (that is, simple rear-end motor 
vehicle collision, sitting position in ED, 
ambulatory at any time since injury, 
delayed onset of neck pain, absence of 
midline cervical spine tenderness?) 
x Is the patient able to actively rotate 
their neck 45 degrees to the left and 
right? 
For the NEXUS rule, absence of five 
criteria are used to classify the patient 
as low risk. 
x No midline cervical tenderness. 
x No focal neurological deficit. 
x Normal alertness. 
x No intoxication. 
x No painful distracting injury. 
Both papers present high quality 
evidence, the NEXUS rule is level one 
evidence although they validated their 
rule by asking each doctor whether the 
patient was high or low risk using the 
rule rather than compelling the attending 
physician to follow the rule. The 
validation phase of the Canadian 
cervical spine rules has now been 
completed and successfully validates the 
rule.  
The NEXUS study122 collected 
prospective data on 34,069 patients in 
twenty-one hospitals in the USA who 
underwent cervical imaging following 
blunt trauma. Included were patients at 
all levels of alertness, and children. The 
Canadian cervical spine rule studied 
8,924 patients in ten large Canadian",111,LEFT,206,Page 111 (LEFT)
chunk_111_RIGHT,"community and university hospitals who 
underwent cervical imaging following 
blunt trauma. Only adults with a GCS 
score equal to 15 were included. 
The Canadian cervical spine rule 
excluded patients who were not fully 
alert at the time of assessment (that is, 
GCS equal to 15) on the assumption that 
these patients would automatically 
receive cervical spine imaging. The 
NEXUS rule included all levels of 
alertness. The NEXUS paper reports an 
overall cervical fracture rate of 2.4% 
and a clinically significant fracture rate 
of 1.7%, while the Canadian paper 
reports an overall fracture rate of 2.0% 
with a clinically significant cervical spine 
fracture rate of 1.7%. The NEXUS rule 
had no age exclusion whereas the 
Canadian rules were derived and 
validated only on patients aged over 16 
years. 
The Canadian cervical spine rule gives a 
sensitivity of 100% (95% CI: 98-100) 
and NEXUS gives a sensitivity of 99.6% 
(95% CI: 98.6-100). The NEXUS rule is 
not 100% sensitive but of the two 
clinically significant missed fractures one 
had an extension-teardrop fracture and 
self discharged. He was well at six 
months. One had a fracture of the right 
lamina of the sixth cervical vertebra 
requiring open fixation, but may have 
been incorrectly classified as low risk by 
the institution as he had loss of 
consciousness and neurological signs. Of 
interest, Stiell et al tested the NEXUS 
rule on the Canadian cervical spine 
cohort and found that the sensitivity of 
the NEXUS rule was only 93%. They also 
criticise the NEXUS rule for the poor",111,RIGHT,252,Page 111 (RIGHT)
chunk_112_LEFT,"119

reproducibility of ‘presence of 
intoxication’ and ‘distracting painful 
injuries’. These criticisms have not been 
accepted by the developers of the 
NEXUS rules, who argued that that the 
data collected by the Canadian group 
was inadequate to properly test the 
NEXUS criteria (Hoffman JR, personal 
communication). 
The main difference in the performance 
of the rules lies in specificity. The NEXUS 
rule has a specificity of 13% (95% CI: 
12.8-13.0) whereas the specificity of the 
Canadian cervical spine rule is 42% 
(95% CI: 40-44) for clinically significant 
injuries. In addition the Canadian 
cervical spine rule detected 27 out of 28 
clinically insignificant spine fractures. 
Because of the very large difference in 
specificity the ordering rate produced 
by the two rules is also markedly 
different. The NEXUS rule requires an 
87% three-view plain radiography rate, 
whereas the Canadian cervical spine 
rule requires a 58% rate. It is important 
to note that NEXUS only found 498 of 
the 818 cervical spine abnormalities on 
plain radiography, as a very high 
number of plain radiographs were of 
inadequate quality. Another issue of 
concern is that 23 of the cervical 
fractures that were categorised as high 
risk by the NEXUS rule had plain 
radiographs that missed the fracture 
even though they were of good quality. 
These fractures were only picked up as 
further imaging was performed. The 
Canadian cervical spine rule paper did 
not comment on how many of their plain 
radiographs were of inadequate 
quality, and therefore how many",112,LEFT,260,Page 112 (LEFT)
chunk_112_RIGHT,"patients had their fracture picked up by 
additional imaging. 
In the Canadian study, 68% of the 
sample underwent plain radiography. 
All participants were telephoned at 14 
days to assess for any missed injuries, as 
there was no other universal gold 
standard imaging applied, but 577 
participants originally entered into the 
study could not be traced by telephone 
and did not have a cervical spine 
radiograph and so were later excluded. 
This is clearly of methodological concern. 
The NEXUS study performed three-view 
imaging in 87% of all participants. They 
had a different follow up protocol in 
that they set up a surveillance protocol, 
looking for any missed fractures 
returning to any of the participating 
hospitals.  None was found. 
The two rules overall adopt very 
different strategies in the generation of 
their rules in that the NEXUS group has 
selected clinical correlates from the 
history and the examination without 
advising any specific tests in the 
examination, whereas the Canadian 
rules have been generated around an 
interim test of the ability to actively 
rotate the neck, thereby increasing the 
specificity markedly. With regard to the 
similarities of the rules, NEXUS 
categorises patients who are not alert as 
high risk, whereas the Canadian rules 
considers such patients to be at high risk 
on an a priori basis. Both identify 
absence of midline tenderness as a 
means of triaging to low risk. NEXUS 
immediately puts them at low risk 
whereas the Canadian rule marks them 
as low risk if they can also rotate the",112,RIGHT,249,Page 112 (RIGHT)
chunk_113_LEFT,"120
 
Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
neck. NEXUS identifies focal neurology 
as high risk and the Canadian rule 
identifies paraesthesia as high risk. 
The main difference in the nature of the 
rules lies in the use of active neck 
rotation. NEXUS did not consider 
removal of the collar for examination as 
a safe procedure prior to imaging, 
whereas the Canadian rule found low 
risk criteria for safely performing active 
neck rotation, a manoeuvre that has an 
excellent specificity for exclusion of neck 
fracture. Due to this great difference in 
ethos, there are many differences in the 
two rules. The Canadians cite age 
greater than or equal to 65 years and 
dangerous mechanism as indications for 
immediate radiography, whereas these 
were not identified in the NEXUS rule. 
The Canadian rule also cites several 
specific low risk factors for the simple 
neck rotation test. The NEXUS rule uses 
painful distracting injury and intoxication 
to select patients for radiography, 
whereas the Canadian investigators did 
not find these as useful as their other 
high risk factors 
The two rules differ greatly in their 
approach to the assessment of patients 
at risk for a cervical injury. The NEXUS 
study is a much larger cohort and 
includes children and those who had a 
GCS score of less than 15. The 
Canadian rule is however much more 
specific and provides a validated rule 
that safely excludes 42% of patients 
who sustained a head injury from 
radiography.  Neither rule however fully 
describes how to diagnose the fracture 
once someone has been identified as at 
high risk, because plain radiography is",113,LEFT,273,Page 113 (LEFT)
chunk_113_RIGHT,"often inadequate and is not always 
100% sensitive. 
6.9.3 
Clinical evidence  from update 2007 
In the update two diagnostic 
studies123,124 were identified (level I 
evidence) that examined patients with 
head injury and suspected cervical spine 
injury.  
One prospective cohort study123 
comprised 7438 consecutive adult 
patients in nine Canadian emergency 
departments with acute trauma to the 
head or neck who were in a stable and 
alert (GCS 15) condition. These patients 
had neck pain or no neck pain but 
visible injury above the clavicle and 
were non-ambulatory and had a 
dangerous mechanism of injury. This 
study sought to validate the CCR and 
also compares the outcomes to the 
NEXUS low risk criteria (NLR). Patients 
received an X-ray when ordered by the 
treating physician or were followed up 
with a structured telephone interview 
with a nurse to ensure no injuries were 
missed.  
162 patients (2%) had cervical spine 
injury. The CCR had a higher sensitivity 
than NLC, which was 99.4% (95% CI, 
96-100) compared to 90.7% (95% CI, 
85-94) respectively. CCR had a higher 
specificity (45.1% [95% CI, 44-46]) 
compared to NLC (36.8% [95% CI, 3638]). CCR had a lower ordering rate 
than NLC (55.9% vs 66.6%). The CCR 
missed one injury compared to NLC 
which only identified 147 of the 162 
cervical spine injuries. There was an",113,RIGHT,216,Page 113 (RIGHT)
chunk_114_LEFT,"121
 
Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
additional 845 patients selected that 
were excluded for the primary analysis. 
These patients were excluded as they 
were not tested on range of motion 
which is one of the criteria for the CCR 
prediction rule. Secondary analysis was 
conducted including these ‘indeterminate’ 
patients. 
The second prospective cohort study 
retrieved124 compared the CCR and 
physicians judgement. This study 
comprised 6265 adult patients in ten 
Canadian emergency departments who 
were in a stable and alert (GCS 15) 
condition and had neck pain or no neck 
pain but visible injury above the clavicle 
and were non-ambulatory and had a 
dangerous mechanism of injury. This 
population was from Phase 1 of the 
original derivation study for the CCR. 
Physician’s judgement was assessed to 
predict at least 0% probability of 
clinically important cervical spine injury. 
Patients received X-rays as requested 
by judgement of the treating physician 
or were followed up at 14 days by 
structured telephone interview. There 
were 64 (1%) clinically important 
cervical spine injuries detected. CCR had 
a higher sensitivity of 100% (95% CI, 
94-100) compared to physician 
judgement of 92.2% (95% CI, 94-100). 
Specificity was 44.0% (95% CI, 43-45) 
for CCR compared to 53.9% (95% CI, 
82-96) for physician judgement. 
6.9.4 
Economics Evidence from 2007 update 
There were no new published economic 
evidence for this question found in the 
update. We updated the unit costs in our 
cost analysis. The cost savings from the 
Canadian Cervical Spine Rule compared",114,LEFT,254,Page 114 (LEFT)
chunk_114_RIGHT,"with the NEXUS rule were still present 
but were now more modest since 
radiology costs are lower. 
6.9.5 
Summary of evidence from 2007 
update 
The Canadian Cervical Spine Rule had a 
higher sensitivity than NEXUS low risk 
criteria and physician judgement. It 
should be noted that both studies123,124 
came from the Canadian Cervical Spine 
Rule group. There is no new evidence to 
support CT spine for people with mild 
head injuries. 
The Canadian Cervical Spine Rule still 
appears to be less costly than the 
NEXUS rule. 
6.9.6 
Rationale behind recommendation 
In the 2003 guideline two evidence 
based decision rules for selection of 
patients who sustained a head injury for 
imaging of the cervical spine have been 
described. There was no clear means of 
choosing one over the other, and the 
choice of rule was therefore based on 
consensus. Based on the Guideline 
Development Group 2003 consensus, it 
was decided that the Canadian cervical 
spine rules should be used to identify 
patients who will require imaging of the 
cervical spine. 
In order to provide guidance that covers 
all possibilities, the Canadian cervical 
spine rule had been slightly adapted as 
follows. 
x Patients with GCS less than 15 at the 
time of assessment should have cervical 
spine imaging.",114,RIGHT,206,Page 114 (RIGHT)
chunk_115_LEFT,"122
 
Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
x Patients with focal neurological deficit 
should be included in the rule. 
x Patients who have non-symptomatic 
risk factors (that is, are aged greater 
than or equal to 65 years, or who have 
had a dangerous mechanism of injury) 
should have some neck pain or 
tenderness before receiving cervical 
spine imaging. 
UPDATE 2007: 
The GDG decided that no change should 
be made to the original recommendation 
that the Canadian Cervical Spine Rule 
(CCR) should be used for selecting 
patients with cervical spine damage for 
the most accurate imaging technique. 
The GDG agreed that in cases where 
there is a severe head injury to an adult, 
a CT cervical spine examination is 
required. Adults and children age 10 or 
over should have a CT cervical spine if 
they are having a CT of the head. CT of 
all cervical spines is not recommended 
as there is no evidence to support this 
practice. 
6.9.7 
Recommendation 
For Adults - 
[Amended] Adult patients should have 
three-view radiographic imaging of 
the cervical spine requested 
immediately if any of the following 
points apply: 
- There is neck pain or midline 
tenderness with:  
o Age 65 years or older, or",115,LEFT,210,Page 115 (LEFT)
chunk_115_RIGHT,"o dangerous mechanism of injury (fall 
from greater than 1 metre or five 
stairs; axial load to head for example, 
diving; high-speed motor vehicle 
collision; rollover motor accident; 
ejection from a motor vehicle; accident 
involving motorized recreational 
vehicles; bicycle collision). 
- It is not considered safe to assess 
the range of movement in the neck for 
reasons other than those above. 
- It is considered safe to assess the 
range of movement in the neck and, 
on assessment, the patient cannot 
actively rotate the neck to 45 degrees 
to the left and right; safe assessment 
can be carried out if the patient: 
o was involved in a simple rear-end 
motor vehicle collision 
o is comfortable in a sitting position in 
the emergency department 
o has been ambulatory at any time 
since injury with no midline cervical 
spine tenderness 
o presents with delayed onset of neck 
pain. 
- A definitive diagnosis of cervical 
spine injury is required urgently (for 
example, before surgery).  
These recommendations are based on 
level one evidence and are considered 
to be grade A recommendations. 
The Guideline Development Group 
2003 considered this recommendation to 
be interim and dependant on future 
research likely to appear in time for the",115,RIGHT,200,Page 115 (RIGHT)

update guideline specifically the peer 
reviewed publication of the validation 
phase of the Canadian cervical spine 
rules. 
For Children - 
[NEW] Children under 10 years of age 
with GCS of 8 or less should have CT 
imaging of the cervical spine within 1 
hour of presentation or when they are 
sufficiently stable. 
The recommendation is based on GDG 
opinion.  
6.10 
Using adult rules with infants and children 
The literature on cervical spine injury in 
infants and children has not to date 
produced highly sensitive and specific 
clinical decision rules based on level one 
evidence that can be used to select such 
patients for imaging cervical spine. 
There is evidence that the prevalence of 
spinal injuries in children and infants with 
head injury is much lower than in adults 
but to date no clearly defined rules with 
acceptable sensitivity and specificity 
have been produced.125,126 
In this update new clinical prediction 
rules for head imaging have been 
examined in children and have been 
recommended for the head. However no 
studies have investigated clinician 
prediction rules for the cervical spine in 
children, therefore no new 
recommendation is suggested for use in 
children.",116,LEFT,206,Page 116 (LEFT)
chunk_116_RIGHT,"6.10.1 
Recommendations for research 
The GDG identified the following 
priority areas for research. 
6.10.1.1 
Research Question 
Research is needed to establish the 
validity of previously derived clinical 
decision rules on the selection of head 
injured infants and children for CT 
scanning to exclude significant brain 
injury.  
6.10.1.2 Why this research is important 
The 2002 NICE guidelines recommended 
that children be selected for CT scanning 
on the basis of the Canadian Head CT 
rule, a clinical decision rule derived and 
validated in adults. This was due to the 
absence of such a rule derived in 
children. However since this date the 
CHALICE rule has been published which 
presents a clinical decision rule derived 
in a large group of children and infants 
from the UK with good sensitivity and 
specificity.  
However, clinical decision rules often 
provide an overestimate of their 
performance when applied to new 
populations. We now recommend the 
usage of the CHALICE rule for children 
suffering a head injury in the UK, with 
the caveat that a validation of the rule 
in a new population of head injured UK 
patients be urgently undertaken to 
ensure its reliability and reproducibility.    
Such a study is now essential and 
performing a validation of the CHALICE 
study in a novel UK population may 
easily be performed in a 1-2 year 
timeframe with acceptable costs, and",116,RIGHT,221,Page 116 (RIGHT)
chunk_117_LEFT,"124
 
Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
considerable benefits in terms of 
assuring clinicians as to the safety of this 
novel rule.  
6.11 
Piloting the new rules 
The process of implementing these 
guidelines is beyond the Guideline 
Development Group but it is 
recommended that the clinical decision 
rules advocated in this chapter be 
piloted and their usage and impact on 
health outcomes analysed at a small 
number of representative hospitals 
before being broadly adopted. The 
Guideline Development Group 2003 
were aware that both the head and 
cervical spine imaging rules advocated 
were derived from a Canadian sample, 
where the proportion of head injury 
episodes involving assaults and the 
influence of alcohol is apparently much 
lower, and the proportion involving road 
traffic accidents much higher, than in the 
UK. It is unclear how this could impact on 
CT ordering rates following adoption of 
the rules in a UK context.  
6.12 
Non-accidental injury in children 
These guidelines are not intended to 
cover the acute management of nonaccidental injury, but it is important that 
health professionals are aware that the 
head injury examination is an important 
opportunity to identify this problem. 
There is evidence that a distinct pattern 
of brain injuries is associated with nonaccidental injury in children. This results 
from the different mechanisms of injury 
in accidental versus non-accidental head 
injury.   
UPDATE 2007:",117,LEFT,231,Page 117 (LEFT)
chunk_117_RIGHT,"[Amended] A clinician with expertise 
in non-accidental injuries in children 
should be involved in any suspected 
case of non-accidental injury in a 
child. Examinations/investigations that 
should be considered include: skull Xray as part of a skeletal survey, 
ophthalmoscopic examination for 
retinal haemorrhage, and examination 
for pallor, anaemia, and tense 
fontanelle or other suggestive features. 
Other imaging such as CT and MRI 
may be required to define injuries.  
This recommendation is based on level 
five evidence and is considered to be a 
grade D recommendation. 
Work on the derivation of clinical 
decision rules to predict non-accidental 
injury based on imaging patterns has 
recently been begun.127 However, the 
decision rules in this area will require 
substantial validation before they can 
inform clinical practice. Future versions of 
this guideline should determine the status 
of research in this area. 
6.13 
Good practice in emergency department 
assessment 
The following should be practised 
during emergency department 
assessment. 
- The priority for all emergency 
department patients is the stabilisation 
of airway, breathing and circulation 
(ABC) before attention to other injuries. 
- Depressed conscious level should be 
ascribed to intoxication only after a 
significant brain injury has been 
excluded.",117,RIGHT,191,Page 117 (RIGHT)
chunk_118_LEFT,"125
 
Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
- All emergency department clinicians 
involved in the assessment of patients 
with a head injury should be capable 
of assessing the presence or absence 
of the risk factors in the guidance on 
patient selection and urgency for 
imaging (head and cervical spine – 
see previous recommendations). 
Training should be available as 
required to ensure that this is the case.  
- Patients presenting to the emergency 
department with impaired 
consciousness (GCS less than 15) 
should be assessed immediately by a 
trained member of staff. 
- In patients with a GCS less than or 
equal to 8 there should be early 
involvement of an anaesthetist or 
critical care physician to provide 
appropriate airway management, as 
described in section 7.8.6, and to 
assist with resuscitation. 
- All patients presenting to an 
emergency departments with a head 
injury should be assessed by a trained 
member of staff within a maximum of 
15 minutes of arrival at hospital. Part 
of this assessment should establish 
whether they are high risk or low risk 
for clinically important brain injury 
and/or cervical spine injury, using the 
guidance on patient selection and 
urgency for imaging (head and 
cervical spine – see previous 
recommendations). 
[Amended] In patients considered to 
be at high risk for clinically important 
brain injury and/or cervical spine 
injury, assessment should be extended",118,LEFT,233,Page 118 (LEFT)
chunk_118_RIGHT,"to full clinical examination to establish 
the need to request CT imaging of the 
head and/or imaging of the cervical 
spine. The guidance on patient 
selection and urgency for imaging 
(head and cervical spine) should form 
the basis for the final decision on 
imaging after discussion with the 
radiology department. See 
recommendations 3.5.3.1 to 3.5.4.2 
(imaging of the head) and 3.5.5.1 to 
3.5.7.2 (imaging of the cervical spine).  
[Amended] Patients who, on initial 
assessment, are considered to be at 
low risk for clinically important brain 
injury and/or cervical spine injury 
should be re-examined within a 
further hour by an emergency 
department clinician. Part of this 
assessment should fully establish the 
need to request CT imaging of the 
head and/or imaging of the cervical 
spine. The guidance on patient 
selection and urgency for imaging 
(head and cervical spine) should again 
form the basis for the final decision on 
imaging after discussion with the 
radiology department. See 
recommendations 3.5.3.1 to 3.5.4.2 
(imaging of the head) and 3.5.5.1 to 
3.5.7.2 (imaging of the cervical spine).   
[NEW] Pain should be managed 
effectively because it can lead to a rise 
in intracranial pressure. Reassurance 
and splintage of limb fractures are 
helpful; catheterisation of a full 
bladder will reduce irritability. 
Significant pain should be treated with 
small doses of intravenous opioids 
titrated against clinical response and",118,RIGHT,220,Page 118 (RIGHT)

baseline cardiorespiratory 
measurements.   
[Amended] Throughout the hospital 
episode, all healthcare professionals 
should use a standard head injury 
proforma in their documentation when 
assessing and observing patients with 
head injury. This form should be of a 
consistent format across all clinical 
departments and hospitals in which a 
patient might be treated. A separate 
proforma for those under 16 years 
should be used. Areas to allow extra 
documentation should be included (for 
example, in cases of non-accidental 
injury). (Examples of proformas that 
should be used in patients with head 
injury are provided in Appendices J, 
K1 and K2).  
It is recommended that in-hospital 
observation of patients with a head 
injury, including all emergency 
department observation, should only 
be conducted by professionals 
competent in the assessment of head 
injury.

department within 48 hours of

complaint relating to the initial head 
injury should be seen by or discussed 
with a senior clinician experienced in 
head injuries, and considered for a CT 
scan.

Imaging practice and involvement of 
the neurosurgical department
7.1 
Good practice in imaging of patients with 
a head injury 
It is assumed that general principles of 
good practice in imaging will be 
adhered to, as outlined in publications 
by the Royal College of Radiologists.14 
On the basis of consensus, the Guideline 
Development Group has made the 
following recommendations. 
x All CT scans of the head should be 
reviewed by a clinician who has been 
deemed competent to review such 
images. 
x All plain radiographs of the cervical 
spine should be reviewed by a 
clinician who has been deemed 
competent to review such images. 
x Where necessary, transport or 
transmission of images should be used 
to ensure that a competent clinician 
review the images. 
x All imaging performed on patients 
with head injury should have a full or 
interim written report for the patients’",120,LEFT,161,Page 120 (LEFT)
chunk_120_RIGHT,"notes within an hour of the procedure 
having been performed. 
x Imaging of any kind should not 
delay neurosurgical or anaesthetic 
referral in patients with severe head 
injury. (D) 
These recommendations are based on 
level five evidence and are considered 
to be grade D recommendations. 
7.2 
Urgency in performing CT of the head 
Given the demands on CT scanners and 
radiologists trained in their use it is 
important to distinguish between those 
patients for whom CT imaging is 
required ‘urgently’ and those where CT 
can be performed ‘within a reasonable 
period’. 
Given that it is proposed that selection 
for head imaging be based upon the 
Canadian CT-head rules, it is possible to 
distinguish between those patients at 
high risk for neurosurgical intervention 
(the five point rules) and those at high 
risk for non-neurosurgical clinically",120,RIGHT,134,Page 120 (RIGHT)
chunk_121_LEFT,"128
 
Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
important brain injuries (the seven point 
rules). The former set of patients will 
need CT imaging to be performed 
urgently (that is, within one hour of the 
request having been received) whereas 
the latter patients can wait for a 
reasonable period (8 hours) before 
imaging.  
[Amended] CT imaging of the head 
should be performed (that is, imaging 
carried out and results analysed) 
within 1 hour of the request having 
been received by the radiology 
department in those patients where 
imaging is requested because of any 
of the following risk factors: 
- GCS less than 13 on initial 
assessment in the emergency 
department. 
- GCS less than 15 at 2 hours after the 
injury. 
- Suspected open or depressed skull 
fracture. 
- Any sign of basal skull fracture 
(haemotympanum, ‘panda’ eyes, 
cerebrospinal fluid leakage from the 
ear or nose, Battle’s sign). 
- More than one episode of vomiting 
in adults; three or more episodes of 
vomiting in children.  
- Post-traumatic seizure. 
- Coagulopathy (history of bleeding, 
clotting disorder, current treatment 
with warfarin) providing that some 
loss of consciousness or amnesia has 
been experienced; patients receiving 
antiplatelet therapy may be at 
increased risk of intracranial bleeding,",121,LEFT,211,Page 121 (LEFT)
chunk_121_RIGHT,"though this is currently unquantified – 
clinical judgement should be used to 
assess the need for an urgent scan in 
these patients.     
- Focal neurological deficit. 
[Amended] Patients who have any of 
the following risk factors and none of 
the risk factors above should have 
their CT imaging performed within 8 
hours of the injury (imaging should be 
performed immediately in these 
patients if they present 8 hours or 
more after their injury): 
- Amnesia for events more than 30 
minutes before impact (the assessment 
of amnesia will not be possible in preverbal children and is unlikely to be 
possible in any child aged under 5 
years). 
- Age 65 years or older, providing 
that some loss of consciousness or 
amnesia has been experienced. 
- 
Dangerous mechanism of injury 
(a pedestrian struck by a motor 
vehicle, an occupant ejected from a 
motor vehicle or a fall from a height of 
greater than 1 metre or five stairs) 
providing that some loss of 
consciousness or amnesia has been 
experienced. 
These recommendations are based on 
level two evidence and are considered 
to be grade B recommendations. 
7.3 
Cervical spine imaging urgency 
The demands on X-ray facilities are not 
as pressing as those on CT facilities and 
there is no consequent need to 
discriminate between different",121,RIGHT,213,Page 121 (RIGHT)
chunk_122_LEFT,"129
 
Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
categories of patient requiring cervical 
spine imaging. Cervical spine imaging if 
indicated should be carried out urgently 
as these patients will often need CT of 
the head once the cervical spine has 
been cleared. 
[Amended] Imaging of the cervical 
spine should be performed within 1 
hour of a request having been 
received by the radiology department 
or when the patient is sufficiently 
stable. Where a request for urgent CT 
imaging of the head (that is, within 1 
hour) has also been received, the 
cervical spine imaging should be 
carried out simultaneously. 
This recommendation is based on level 
five evidence and is considered to be a 
grade D recommendation. 
7.4 
Involving neurosurgical care 
The care of all patients with new, 
surgically significant abnormalities on 
imaging should be discussed with a 
neurosurgeon. The definition of 
‘surgically significant’ should be 
developed by local neurosurgical 
centres and agreed with referring 
hospitals. An example of a 
neurosurgical referral letter is shown 
in Appendix L .13. 
This recommendation is based on level 
five evidence and is considered to be a 
grade D recommendation. 
Examples of abnormalities not surgically 
significant have been produced by a 
survey of neuroradiologists and 
emergency physicians in Canada.25  
However, these criteria have not to date",122,LEFT,220,Page 122 (LEFT)
chunk_122_RIGHT,"been accepted by UK neurosurgeons, 
and a survey carried out in 2003 by the 
Society of British Neurological Surgeons 
found substantial concern about the 
Canadian criteria.  The UK survey was 
carried out specifically to complement 
the development of this guideline. It 
would be desirable if the criteria to be 
used in this area could be based on the 
opinion of UK neurosurgeons. 
7.4.1 
Recommendations for research 
The GDG identified the following 
priority areas for research in the 
original guideline as well as in this 
update. 
7.4.1.1 
Research Question 
Research is needed to develop consensus 
on criteria for lesions not currently 
considered to be surgically significant 
following imaging of a patient with 
head injury. 
Although most neurosurgeons agree 
about which extradural and subdural 
haematomas should be removed, there is 
controversy about whether or not to 
remove traumatic intracerebral 
haemorrhage (TICH) and cerebral 
contusions (CC). A prospective 
randomised controlled trial (PRCT) 
should be set up to discover if early 
surgery improves the outcome in these 
lesions compared to initial conservative 
treatment. 
7.4.1.2 Why this research is important 
One option in the management of 
traumatic intracerebral haemorrhage 
(TICH) and cerebral contusions (CC) is to",122,RIGHT,191,Page 122 (RIGHT)
chunk_123_LEFT,"130
 
Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
monitor the patient clinically or with 
intracranial pressure monitoring and 
other forms of brain tissue monitoring 
such as brain tissue oxygen (BtO2) or 
microdialysis. When the patient 
deteriorates, he or she is rushed to the 
operating theatre. The problem is that 
this approach has never been validated 
in a prospective randomised controlled 
trial (PRCT). Waiting until there is 
deterioration in the level of consciousness 
(LOC) or until there is deterioration in 
the monitoring parameters builds delay 
into the management and results in 
secondary brain damage occurring and 
becoming established before surgery in 
all such cases. The principle of early 
surgical evacuation of spontaneous 
intracerebral haemorrhage (SICH) has 
been investigated in the surgical trial in 
intracerebral haemorrhage (STICH) and 
reported in the Lancet (2005). The 
results of such a PRCT in TICH would 
fundamentally alter the 
recommendations made by NICE, in 
terms of which patients should be 
referred to neurosurgery and, more 
importantly, how they should be 
managed there. There is no level 1 
evidence about what to do with these 
patients and the need for such a PRCT in 
head injured patients is urgent. This 
research question should immediately be 
put to UK Research Funding bodies. 
7.5 
Other reasons for discussing a patient’s 
care with a neurosurgeon 
Other criteria for discussing a patient’s 
care with a neurosurgeon were 
developed by both Guideline 
Development Group consensus and",123,LEFT,243,Page 123 (LEFT)
chunk_123_RIGHT,"recommendations from previous 
guidelines.13 
Regardless of imaging, other reasons 
for discussing a patient’s care plan 
with a neurosurgeon include: 
- persisting coma (GCS less than or 
equal to 8) after initial resuscitation. 
- unexplained confusion which 
persists for more than 4 hours 
- deterioration in GCS score after 
admission (greater attention should be 
paid to motor response deterioration) 
- progressive focal neurological signs 
- a seizure without full recovery 
- definite or suspected penetrating 
injury 
- a cerebrospinal fluid leak. 
This recommendation is based on level 
five evidence and is considered to be a 
grade D recommendation. 
7.6 
Criteria for neurosurgical interventions 
These guidelines assume best practice 
will be followed once neurosurgeons 
have become involved with a particular 
patient. The exact nature and timing of 
the interventions is beyond the scope of 
the guidelines. 
7.7 
Transfer from secondary to tertiary care 
settings 
The risk of a further injury to patients 
during transfer to tertiary care is well 
established.128 In the previous guideline 
transfer of the patient between a 
general hospital and a neurosciences 
unit were advised to follow the 
principles set out by the 
Neuroanaesthesia Society of Great",123,RIGHT,188,Page 123 (RIGHT)
chunk_124_LEFT,"131
 
Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
Britain and Ireland and the Association 
of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and 
Ireland.129 The recommendations are 
listed below see section 7.9.7 with slight 
modifications to wording so that they fit 
the style of these guidelines. The PaCO2 
targets recommended for intubated 
patients are based on recent literature 
in this area.130-132 Since the original 
guideline there has been an update of 
the guidance from the Association of 
Anaesthetists133 which has been 
reviewed in this update and 
recommendations have been revised 
accordingly see section 7.8.6. 
7.8 
What are the benefits for patients of 
receiving treatment at a neurosciences 
centre who have suffered a clinically 
important brain injury that does not 
require surgical intervention? 
7.8.1 
Introduction and rationale for the 
clinical question 
There is no uncertainty about the 
management of patients with operative 
lesions; they must be transferred to the 
neurosciences unit for their operation. 
However, there is concern that patients 
who have suffered a clinically important 
brain injury, who are initially referred to 
an emergency department but do not 
have an operable lesion, may have a 
poorer outcome if they are not referred 
to a neurosciences centre. The dilemma 
for hospital staff at the DGH is whether 
to keep the patients at that location or 
to transfer them to a neurosciences unit 
to continue with their treatment. This 
question is relevant for clinicians at both 
types of hospitals. It is important to 
address whether the patient will receive 
better non – operative treatment if they",124,LEFT,260,Page 124 (LEFT)
chunk_124_RIGHT,"are transferred to a specialist 
neurosciences centre than if they 
remained at the initial DGH.  
An emergency department is described 
as a local, regional district general 
hospital with no neurosciences unit or a 
non specialist centre whereas a 
neurosciences unit is described as a 
specialist centre or a unit that has 
neurosurgical and neurointensive care 
facilities. 
The main outcome measures for including 
studies in this review were mortality, 
neurological outcome, disability and 
hospital duration and at least one of 
these outcomes were reported in the 
studies. Studies were excluded where; 
x data on head injury patients were not 
provided,  
x the patient group was less than 50% 
head injured patients, 
x  intervention was pre hospital care 
rather than transfer and  
x the outcomes reported only duration 
of transfer and no other outcomes. 
7.8.2 
Clinical evidence  
One study134 was identified that looked 
at interhospital transfer (secondary 
transfer from one hospital to another). 
Three additional studies66,135,136 looked 
at direct transport from the injury scene 
to a DGH or transfer to a neurosciences 
unit from a DGH.  
The first study134 a prospective 
observational study (level 2+ evidence) 
included patients of any age who were 
injured by blunt trauma between 1996-",124,RIGHT,197,Page 124 (RIGHT)
chunk_125_LEFT,"132
 
Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
2003 (n=6921). These patients were 
treated by participating hospitals in the 
Trauma Audit and Research Network 
(TARN), in the United Kingdom. The 
intervention group (n=4616) patients 
received care at a neurosurgical centre 
(including those who had been 
transferred which was 53% 
(2677/4982)). The control group 
(n=2305) patients received all their 
care in hospitals without neurosurgical 
facilities on site. The mortality rate for 
all patients that were transported to a 
neurosciences unit was 35% (95% CI, 
34-37%) and for those that were 
transported to the emergency 
department was 61% (95% CI, 5963%). The mortality rate for the 
subgroup (n=894) of patients with 
isolated, non-surgical severe head injury 
who were transported to a neurosciences 
unit was 26%, (95% CI, 22-29%) and 
for those that were transported to the 
emergency department the rate was 
34% (95% CI, 39-40%), p=0.005.  
The second study66 a retrospective 
observational cohort study (level 2+ 
evidence) examined the issue of bypass, 
which obtained data from the New York 
State Trauma Registry from 1996-1998. 
The population consisted of adults more 
than 13 years of age with a GCS less 
than 14. A sub group of 2763 head 
injured patients from the data set of 
5419 trauma patients was analysed. 
The patients in the intervention group 
(n=1430 (51.8%)) were transported to 
a regional trauma centre. These patients 
were assessed via the American Triage 
system (pre hospital care) and referred 
directly to the emergency department of 
a regional centre. The comparison group",125,LEFT,257,Page 125 (LEFT)
chunk_125_RIGHT,"(n=1333 (48.2%)) were transferred to 
an area/non trauma centre. These 
patients were assessed via the American 
Triage system (pre hospital care) and 
referred directly to either an area 
centre or a non trauma centre. The 
mortality for transfer to regional centre 
versus non trauma centre was OR of 
0.67 (95% CI, 0.53-0.85). 
In another study135, a low quality study 
(level 3 evidence), where patients were 
directly transported to neurosurgical 
care or secondarily transferred from a 
DGH, the population group were 
neurosurgical unit patients with an 
extradural haematoma requiring 
surgery (n=104). Group 1 patients 
(n=71) had a mean age of 22 years 
(±2SE) were directly transported to a 
neurosurgical centre. Group 2 patients 
(n=33) had a mean age 20years (±3SE) 
and were transferred from the DGH to 
a neurosurgical centre. The results using 
the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) 
show that mortality in group 1 was 4% 
(3/71) and in group 2 was 24% (8/33). 
The moderate/severe disability in group 
1 was 10% (7/71) and group 2 was 
27% (9/33). Recovery was good in 
86% (61/71) of group 1 patients and 
49% (16/33) in group 2, with 
p0.0002. 
The final study136 was a well designed 
cohort study (level 2++ evidence) 
looking at mortality outcomes between 
patients directly transferred to a trauma 
centre and those who were transferred 
first to a non-trauma centre, and then on 
to a trauma centre. This cohort study 
included severely traumatic brain injured 
patients. The data was collected as part 
of a multi-centre online database",125,RIGHT,247,Page 125 (RIGHT)
chunk_126_LEFT,"133

designed to track pre-hospital and inhospital severe TBI patient data, called 
TBI-trac. All patients passing through the 
trauma centres were included, and 
selection criteria were applied. 
Therefore, out of 1449, only 1123 
patients were included; the remainder 
were excluded on the basis of a welldefined criterion, which included the 
mechanism of injury, death, brain death, 
or otherwise not benefiting from the 
care on offer. The authors compared, 
using a logistic regression model, twoweek mortality outcomes between 
patients directly transferred to a trauma 
centre (n=864, 77.3%), and those who 
were transferred first to a non-trauma 
centre, and then on to a trauma 
centre(n=254, 22.7%). The model 
controlled for baseline characteristics 
and clinical data including hypotension 
status on day one, if the patient was less 
than or more than 60 years old, pupil 
status on day 1, and the initial GCS. 
Admission time and time by transport 
status were found to not affect the 
significance of the results. Patients were 
found to have a significantly lower 
chance of mortality with direct transfer 
with an odds ratio of 1.48 (CI 1.032.12) and p=0.04. 
7.8.3 
Economics Evidence from 2007 update 
There was no new economic evidence for 
this question found in the update. 
7.8.4 
Summary of evidence from 2007 
update 
Only one study134 provides some good 
evidence that all patients with severe 
head injuries (GCS 8 or less) would 
benefit from receiving treatment in a",126,LEFT,248,Page 126 (LEFT)
chunk_126_RIGHT,"neurosurgical unit irrespective of any 
need for a neurosurgical operation 
instead of receiving treatment at the 
emergency department. This study found 
data which suggests that treatment in a 
neurosciences centre offers a better 
strategy for the management of severe 
head injury. This study did not address 
direct transfer from the scene, only interhospital transfers. There is 
evidence135,136 which suggests good 
recovery, better mortality and morbidity 
rates amongst severely injured patients 
who bypass the DGH and go to the 
neurosciences unit. However another 
study66 suggests very little difference.  
7.8.5 
Rationale behind recommendation 
A slight amendent to the previous 
recommendation was required (see 
7.8.6). The GDG felt that there is 
evidence to support a recommendation 
for severely head injured to receive 
treatment in a neurosurgical unit 
irrespective of any need for a 
neurosurgical operation and have 
included an amendent to the 
recommendation below 7.8.6. The GDG 
agreed that the studies66,135,136 did not 
provide enough evidence for this 
question to demonstrate that all patients 
should be sent directly to receive 
treatment in a neurosurgical unit 
irrespective of any need for a 
neurosurgical operation. This is because 
the GDG recognises that this would 
require a major shift of resources of 
between an additional 84,000 and 
105,000 bed days to neurosurgery from 
the existing general surgical, 
orthopaedic, emergency department, 
paediatric and geriatric services that",126,RIGHT,219,Page 126 (RIGHT)
chunk_127_LEFT,"134
 
Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
currently care for these patients. The 
GDG agreed that whilst there are not 
enough resources for all head injury 
patients to go to a neurosciences centre, 
we should aspire to improve the rate of 
transfer. The GDG opinion therefore is 
to propose this area for further research 
(see section 7.9.1). 
7.8.6 
Recommendation 
For adults: 
[Amended] Local guidelines on the 
transfer of patients with head injuries 
should be drawn up between the 
referring hospital trusts, the 
neuroscience unit and the local 
ambulance service, and should 
recognise that: 
- transfer would benefit all patients 
with serious head injuries (GCS  8), 
irrespective of the need for 
neurosurgery 
- if transfer of those who do not 
require neurosurgery is not possible, 
ongoing liaison with the neuroscience 
unit over clinical management is 
essential.  
[NEW] The possibility of occult 
extracranial injuries should be 
considered for the multiply injured 
adult, and he or she should not be 
transferred to a service that is unable 
to deal with other aspects of trauma. 
There should be a designated 
consultant in the referring hospital 
with responsibility for establishing 
arrangements for the transfer of 
patients with head injuries to a",127,LEFT,207,Page 127 (LEFT)
chunk_127_RIGHT,"neuroscience unit and another 
consultant at the neuroscience unit 
with responsibility for establishing 
arrangements for communication with 
referring hospitals and for receipt of 
patients transferred.  
[Amended] Patients with head injuries 
requiring emergency transfer to a 
neuroscience unit should be 
accompanied by a doctor with 
appropriate training and experience in 
the transfer of patients with acute 
brain injury. The doctor should be 
familiar with the pathophysiology of 
head injury, the drugs and equipment 
they will use and with working in the 
confines of an ambulance (or 
helicopter if appropriate). They should 
have a dedicated and adequately 
trained assistant. They should be 
provided with appropriate clothing for 
the transfer, medical indemnity and 
personal accident insurance. Patients 
requiring non-emergency transfer 
should be accompanied by appropriate 
clinical staff.  
The transfer team should be provided 
with a means of communication with 
their base hospital and the 
neurosurgical unit during the transfer. 
A portable phone may be suitable 
providing it is not used in close 
proximity (that is, within 1 metre) of 
medical equipment prone to electrical 
interference (for example, infusion 
pumps).  
[Amended] Although it is understood 
that transfer is often urgent, initial 
resuscitation and stabilisation of the 
patient should be completed and",127,RIGHT,197,Page 127 (RIGHT)
chunk_128_LEFT,"135
 
Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
comprehensive monitoring established 
before transfer to avoid complications 
during the journey. A who is patient 
persistently hypotensive, despite 
resuscitation, should not be 
transported until the cause of the 
hypotension has been identified and 
the patient stabilised.  
All patients with a GCS less than or 
equal to 8 requiring transfer to a 
neuroscience unit should be intubated 
and ventilated as should any patients 
with the indications detailed in the 
recommendation below. 
[Amended] Intubation and ventilation 
should be used immediately in the 
following circumstances: 
- Coma – not obeying commands, not 
speaking, not eye opening (that is, 
GCS  8). 
- Loss of protective laryngeal reflexes. 
- Ventilatory insufficiency as judged 
by blood gases: hypoxaemia (PaO2< 
13 kPa on oxygen) or hypercarbia 
(PaCO2 > 6 kPa). 
- Spontaneous hyperventilation 
causing PaCO2 < 4 kPa. 
- Irregular respirations.  
[Amended] Intubation and ventilation 
should be used before the start of the 
journey in the following 
circumstances: 
- Significantly deteriorating conscious 
level (one or more points on the motor 
score), even if not coma. 
- Unstable fractures of the facial 
skeleton.",128,LEFT,193,Page 128 (LEFT)
chunk_128_RIGHT,"- Copious bleeding into mouth (for 
example, from skull base fracture). 
- Seizures.  
[Amended] An intubated patient 
should be ventilated with muscle 
relaxation and appropriate shortacting sedation and analgesia. Aim for 
a PaO2 greater than 13 kPa, PaCO2 4.5 
to 5.0 kPa unless there is clinical or 
radiological evidence of raised 
intracranial pressure, in which case 
more aggressive hyperventilation is 
justified. If hyperventilation is used, 
the inspired oxygen concentration 
should be increased. The mean arterial 
pressure should be maintained at 80 
mmHg or more by infusion of fluid 
and vasopressors as indicated. In 
children, blood pressure should be 
maintained at a level appropriate for 
the child’s age.  
Education, training and audit are 
crucial to improving standards of 
transfer; appropriate time and funding 
for these activities should be provided.  
Carers and relatives should have as 
much access to the patient as is 
practical during transfer and be fully 
informed on the reasons for transfer 
and the transfer process. 
These recommendations are based on 
level five evidence and are considered 
to be grade D recommendations. 
7.9 
Transfer of children 
The recommendations in section 7.8.6 
above were written for adults but the 
principles apply equally to children",128,RIGHT,194,Page 128 (RIGHT)
chunk_129_LEFT,"136
 
Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
and infants, providing that the 
paediatric modification of the Glasgow 
Coma Scale is used. 
Service provision in the area of 
paediatric transfer to tertiary care 
should also follow the principles 
outlined in the National Service 
Framework for Paediatric Intensive 
Care. These do not conflict with the 
principles outlined in section 7.5 
above137 .  
Transfer of a child or infant to a 
specialist neurosurgical unit should be 
undertaken by staff experienced in the 
transfer of critically ill children.  
 Families should have as much access 
to their child as is practical during 
transfer and be fully informed on the 
reasons for transfer and the transfer 
process. 
These recommendations are based on 
level five evidence and are considered 
to be grade D recommendations. 
[NEW] The possibility of occult 
extracranial injuries should be 
considered for the multiply injured 
child, and he or she should not be 
transferred to a service that is unable 
to deal with other aspects of trauma. 
7.9.1 
Recommendations for research 
The GDG also identified the following 
priority areas for research. 
7.9.1.1 
Research Question 
Do patients with significant traumatic 
brain injury who do not require 
operative neurosurgical intervention at",129,LEFT,205,Page 129 (LEFT)
chunk_129_RIGHT,"presentation, but are still cared for in 
specialist neurosciences centres, have 
improved clinical outcomes when 
compared to similar patients who are 
treated in non-specialist centres?  
7.9.1.2 
Why this research is important 
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is amongst 
the most important causes of death in 
young adults, with an overall mortality 
for severe TBI of over 50%. TBI care 
consumes one million acute hospital beddays, and over 15,000 ICU bed-days 
annually, and patients who do survive 
significant TBI experience an enormous 
burden of long term physical disability, 
neurocognitive deficits, and 
neuropsychiatric sequelae. The financial 
impact is significant: the NHS spends 
over £1 billion on just the acute hospital 
care of the 10,000 patients with 
significant TBI. The costs of rehabilitation 
and community care are difficult to 
estimate, but probably total many 
multiples of the figure provided for 
acute care. These considerations make 
TBI a national healthcare priority and its 
outcome impact is consistent with its 
inclusion in the National Service 
Framework for Long Term Neurological 
Conditions. 
Current referral of patients with acute 
traumatic brain injury practice is still 
dominated in many parts of the United 
Kingdom by the need for operative 
neurosurgical intervention at 
presentation. This may be inappropriate, 
since many patients with severe head 
injury have evidence of raised 
intracranial pressure in the absence of",129,RIGHT,215,Page 129 (RIGHT)

Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
surgical lesions, and suffer morbidity 
and mortality equal to those with 
surgical lesions. Further, several studies 
provide strong circumstantial evidence 
that managing such “non-surgical” 
patients in specialist neurosciences 
centres may result in substantial 
improvements in mortality and functional 
outcome, probably due to specialist 
expertise in areas of non-operative 
management, such as neurocritical care. 
However, these results may be 
confounded by case-mix effects and 
referral bias, and the cost-effectiveness 
of such specialist management remains 
uncertain. There is a strong case to 
address this question in the context of a 
formal study, since a change in practice 
could have a major impact on death and 
disability in a condition that is a major 
contributor to mortality in healthy young 
adults.  Importantly, the results of such a 
study could fundamentally alter the 
recommendations made by NICE, in 
terms of where patients with head injury 
are treated within the healthcare system, 
and result in better optimised (and 
potentially more cost-effective) patient 
flows within the NHS. 
The available evidence in this area has 
been addressed in the systematic review 
that contributed to the revision of NICE 
Guidelines on the early management of 
head injury. This review could find no 
high quality clinical evidence on the 
topic. This is unsurprising, since any study 
that addressed these issues would have 
to be undertaken within the context of a 
healthcare system and include 
ambulance services, district general 
hospitals and neuroscience referral 
centres. Such a study would therefore",130,LEFT,256,Page 130 (LEFT)
chunk_130_RIGHT,"require the organisational backing of a 
body such as NICE and careful design to 
account for confounds and biases. 
However, we believe that given careful 
design, such a study would be both 
ethically and logistically feasible. The 
patient group is well defined, and 
adequate numbers would be available 
to provide a definitive result within a 
reasonable time frame. While 
circumstantial evidence may support 
transfer of such patients to neurosciences 
centres, current practice is not influenced 
by this view in many regions, and many 
would argue that there is still clinical 
equipoise in this area. There are clear 
risks from transfer, and there could be 
clear harm, both in terms of clinical 
outcome and health economics, if the 
anticipated benefits were not realised. 
On the other hand, if the benefits from 
observational studies were confirmed by 
the trial, the resulting changes in 
management could potentially reduce 
case-mix adjusted mortality by 26% 
and increase the incidence of favourable 
outcome in survivors by nearly 20%.",130,RIGHT,162,Page 130 (RIGHT)

Discharge and follow-up
8.1 
Introduction 
One consequence of these guidelines will 
be a tendency to discharge a higher 
proportion of patients with head injury 
directly from the emergency 
department. At the same time it is 
anticipated that patients admitted for 
in-hospital observation will on average 
have sustained a more severe head 
injury than is currently the case. These 
changes to current admission practice 
will increase the need to ensure that 
patient discharge from hospital is safe 
and carefully planned. A very small 
number of patients will develop late 
complications despite normal CT results 
and an absence of signs and symptoms. 
A well designed system of high quality 
discharge advice and post-discharge 
observation by a carer is required to 
ensure that these patients receive 
appropriate care as soon as possible. 
The role of carers at home in the early 
post-discharge observation of patients is 
important and should be guided by 
clear and detailed information. There 
should be clearly defined pathways 
back to hospital care for patients who",131,LEFT,184,Page 131 (LEFT)
chunk_131_RIGHT,"show signs of late complications. There is 
also a clear need for systematic follow  
up of all grades of patient, given the 
high likelihood of long term disabilities. 
8.2 
Discharge of low risk patients with GCS 
equal to 15 
If CT is not indicated on the basis of 
history and examination the clinician 
may conclude that the risk of clinically 
important brain injury to the patient is 
low enough to warrant transfer to the 
community, as long as no other factors 
that would warrant a hospital 
admission are present (for example, 
drug or alcohol intoxication, other 
injuries, shock, suspected nonaccidental injury, meningism, 
cerebrospinal fluid leak) and there are 
appropriate support structures for safe 
discharge and for subsequent care (for 
example, competent supervision at 
home).  
This recommendation is based on level 
five evidence and is considered to be a 
grade D recommendation.",131,RIGHT,141,Page 131 (RIGHT)

Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
8.3 
Discharge of patients with normal imaging 
of the head 
After normal imaging of the head, the 
clinician may conclude that the risk of 
clinically important brain injury 
requiring hospital care is low enough 
to warrant discharge, as long as the 
patient has returned to GCS equal to 
15, and no other factors that would 
warrant a hospital admission are 
present (for example, drug or alcohol 
intoxication, other injuries, shock, 
suspected non-accidental injury, 
meningism, cerebrospinal fluid leak) 
and there are appropriate support 
structures for safe discharge and for 
subsequent care (for example, 
competent supervision at home).  
This recommendations is based on 
level five evidence and is considered 
to be a grade D recommendation. 
8.4 
Discharge of patients with normal imaging 
of the cervical spine 
After normal imaging of the cervical 
spine the clinician may conclude that 
the risk of injury to the cervical spine 
is low enough to warrant discharge, as 
long as the patient has returned to GCS 
equal to 15 and their clinical 
examination is normal, and no other 
factors that would warrant a hospital 
admission are present (for example, 
drug or alcohol intoxication, other 
injuries, shock, suspected nonaccidental injury, meningism, 
cerebrospinal fluid leak) and there are 
appropriate support structures for safe 
discharge and for subsequent care (for",132,LEFT,227,Page 132 (LEFT)
chunk_132_RIGHT,"example, competent supervision at 
home).  
This recommendation is based on level 
five evidence and is considered to be a 
grade D recommendation. 
8.5 
Discharge of patients admitted for 
observation 
Patients admitted after a head injury 
may be discharged after resolution of 
all significant symptoms and signs 
providing they have suitable 
supervision arrangements at home 
(see also recommendation 6.3.6 for 
those admitted out of hours but who 
require a CT scan).  
This recommendation is based on level 
five evidence and is considered to be a 
grade D recommendation. 
8.6 
Discharge of patients at risk of nonaccidental injury 
No infants or children presenting with 
head injuries that require imaging of 
the head or cervical spine should be 
discharged until assessed by a 
clinician experienced in the detection 
of non-accidental injury.  
It is expected that all personnel 
involved in the assessment of infants 
and children with head injury should 
have training in the detection of nonaccidental injury.  
These recommendations are based on 
level five evidence and are considered 
to be grade D recommendations.",132,RIGHT,170,Page 132 (RIGHT)

liaison with appropriate community care 
and legal organisations are contained in 
a recent Department of Health 
manual.138 
8.7 
Discharge and Glasgow Coma Scale status 
No patients presenting with head 
injury should be discharged until they 
have achieved GCS equal to 15, or 
normal consciousness in infants and 
young children as assessed by the 
paediatric version of the Glasgow 
Coma Scale.  
This recommendation is based on level 
five evidence and is considered to be a 
grade D recommendation. 
8.8 
Discharge advice 
All patients with any degree of head 
injury who are deemed safe for 
appropriate discharge from an 
emergency department or the 
observation ward should receive 
verbal advice and a written head 
injury advice card. The details of the 
card should be discussed with the 
patients and their carers. If necessary 
(for example, patients with literacy 
problems, visual impairment or 
speaking languages without a written 
format), other formats (for example, 
tapes) should be used to communicate 
this information.  Communication in 
languages other than English should 
also be facilitated.  
The risk factors outlined in the card 
should be the same as those used in 
the initial community setting to advise",133,LEFT,222,Page 133 (LEFT)
chunk_133_RIGHT,"patients on emergency department 
attendance. Patients and carers should 
also be alerted to the possibility that 
some patients may make a quick 
recovery, but go on to experience 
delayed complications. Instructions 
should be included on contacting 
community services in the event of 
delayed complications.  
Patients who presented to the 
emergency department with drug or 
alcohol intoxication and are now fit for 
discharge should receive information 
and advice on alcohol or drug misuse.  
These recommendations are based on 
level five evidence and are considered 
to be grade D recommendations. 
Suggested written advice cards for 
patients and carers are provided in 
Appendices E, F and G. 
8.9 
Discharge of patients with no carer at 
home 
All patients with any degree of head 
injury should only be transferred to 
their home if it is certain that there is 
somebody suitable at home to 
supervise the patient. Patients with no 
carer at home should only be 
discharged if suitable supervision 
arrangements have been organised, or 
when the risk of late complications is 
deemed negligible. 
This recommendation is based on level 
five evidence and is considered to be a 
grade D recommendation.",133,RIGHT,187,Page 133 (RIGHT)

8.10 
The best tool for identifying the patients 
who should be referred to rehabilitation 
services following the initial management 
of a head injury 
8.10.1 Introduction and rationale for the 
clinical question 
It is well known that some patients 
labelled as having had a minor head 
injury may experience long term 
disability following discharge from 
hospital. Symptoms such as headache, 
dizziness, memory deficits, slowness of 
thought, poor concentration, 
communication problems, inability to 
work and problems with self-care have 
been described. These patients are 
categorised by the International 
Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) as 
having post-concussional syndrome 
(PCS). 
Five papers were classed as level two 
evidence due to the quality of the study 
design in the original guidleine.33,36,139141However from these papers, only one 
paper139 explicitly constructed a 
decision rule that could be used in the 
acute setting to identify patients at risk 
of PCS. This rule identifies a high-risk 
group that has an 89% risk of PCS and 
a low risk group with a risk of PCS of 
9%. Unfortunately 50% of patients then 
fall into a medium risk category, where 
the risk is 47% for PCS. Therefore the 
only category that may be of use for 
excluding patients from follow up is the 
low risk category, but this category was 
derived from only eleven patients.  
Therefore this study, although being the 
only paper to attempt the derivation of 
a rule is still really only of use to",134,LEFT,252,Page 134 (LEFT)
chunk_134_RIGHT,"researchers looking to improve on their 
findings. 
Of the remaining papers: length of posttraumatic amnesia, period of loss of 
consciousness, abnormal initial GCS, 
gender, age, positive radiological 
findings and various neuropsychometric 
tests have been advocated as being 
associated with an increased risk of PCS, 
but there is no data as to how these 
variables might combine as a decision 
rule for the safe exclusion of low risk 
patients from follow-up. 
In the original guideline, there was 
insufficient evidence for the 
recommendation of any decision rules 
that can safely exclude a patient from 
follow up although several high-risk 
variables have been reported. 
UPDATE 2007: 
In this update, no clinical evidence 
review was carried out due to a vast 
amount of evidence in this area and the 
limited framework of this update. 
Therefore a thorough evidence map was 
conducted to aid future research in this 
area. 
8.10.2 Clinical evidence 
A search was developed to identify 
papers which attempted to develop, 
compare or validate a clinical prediction 
rule which would identify those patients, 
using variables collected during the 
acute phase of care, who would suffer 
long term sequelae and who would 
therefore benefit from rehabilitation. 
We considered systematic reviews, RCTs,",134,RIGHT,197,Page 134 (RIGHT)
chunk_135_LEFT,"142
 
Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
non-randomised controlled trials, cohort 
studies, and case series.  
In total, 394 relevant studies were 
included and put through a rigorous 
coding procedure. The following pieces 
of information were coded for each 
study using the abstract: 
x Aim of the study – whether explicitly 
or implicitly about referral for 
rehabilitation, and also whether it aimed 
to compare, develop or validate a tool, 
or attempted to carry out a multivariate 
analysis and thus infer a referral tool. 
x Population – age group, injury 
severity. Other details were recorded 
under the variables section. Infants are 
children less than 1 year, adults are over 
18. Injury severity was defined using the 
GCS system or if the authors used the 
words ‘mild’, ‘moderate’, or ‘severe’ in 
the abstract.  
x Study design – type of study.  
x Variables considered – these were 
categorised into certain groups. Every 
piece of information explicitly collected 
about the patient was categorised and 
noted. Therefore variables included 
predictors, outcomes, demographics, 
classifying information and so on. 
Ninety two studies were identified as 
being explicitly about tools for referral. 
However, the remaining 302 studies 
were included as in a complete 
systematic review they would contain 
useful information; for example, the 
authors may have investigated variables 
which could be used to form a clinical",135,LEFT,227,Page 135 (LEFT)
chunk_135_RIGHT,"prediction rule without making this 
explicit in the abstract. 
A wide spread of variables was 
identified which included; GCS/GOS or 
other measure of injury severity, S100B, 
Tau protein, Interleukin, other blood 
marker, other clinical data, cognitive 
measure, behavioural measure, 
disability measure, sensory measure, 
imaging measure, quality of life 
measure, social functioning, employment 
outcomes, length of stay, mortality, 
motor skills, demographics, psychosocial 
measure and somatosensory evoked 
potentials (SEPs) 
The population characteristics of age 
and injury severity were not reported in 
the majority of the reports. However, 
the most commonly studied populations 
appeared to be children (93 studies) 
and severely head injured patients (133 
studies).

Conclusion 
The amount of literature identified by 
this search and evidence map was too 
diverse and too great to be 
systematically reviewed within the 
framework of this update. Moreover, the 
GDG felt it would be inappropriate to 
develop a recommendation about 
rehabilitation, given that the economic 
details about rehabilitation are limited. 
Rehabilitation covers a vast time span 
after injury and can encompass many 
different health professionals and is 
measured using many different types of 
outcomes. To derive a single rule, given 
the lack of clear evidence in this field, 
will be a challenging task. However, the",136,LEFT,193,Page 136 (LEFT)
chunk_136_RIGHT,"GDG felt that a rigorous systematic 
review should be carried out to facilitate 
the development of the clinical 
prediction rule. The GDG therefore 
decided to propose a research 
recommendation on this topic. 
8.10.5 
Recommendations for research 
The GDG identified the following 
priority area for research. 
8.10.5.1 Research Question 
Research is needed to summarise and 
identify the optimal predictor variables 
for long term sequelae following mild 
traumatic brain injury. A systematic 
review of the literature could be used to 
derive a clinical decision rule to identify, 
at the time of injury, relevant patients. 
This would in turn lay the foundation for 
a derivation cohort study. 
8.10.5.2 Why this research is important 
We performed a review of the 
literature in this area, repeated in this 
update process. While 394 studies were 
identified that attempted to use a wide 
range of variables and tests to predict a 
range of longer term outcome measures, 
no robust clinical decision tools has 
successfully been derived and validated 
to identify patients at the time of injury 
who could be considered for follow-up 
due to a higher risk of long term 
sequelae. A systematic review of the 
literature would summarise and identify 
the optimal predictor variables for such 
a clinical decision rule and also identify 
the optimal outcome variables, thus 
laying the foundation for a derivation 
cohort study.",136,RIGHT,220,Page 136 (RIGHT)
chunk_137_LEFT,"144
 
Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
The derivation cohort study to create this 
clinical decision rule could potentially be 
conducted in conjunction with the 
validation of the CHALICE rule, with 
follow up of patients involved in this 
study at 6mths-1yr. This would ensure 
optimal value for money for funders and 
ensure good results in a large cohort of 
patients. Separate studies could also be 
performed in adults but the initial study 
may in fact be more urgent in the 
childhood population.  
Identification of patients likely to suffer 
from long term sequelae will allow 
targeted research regarding 
responsiveness to, or effectiveness of 
focused rehabilitation programmes. 
Preventative action could potentially be 
taken, thus reducing the strain on 
resources further down the care 
pathway. Furthermore, patient outcomes 
could potentially be improved by early 
identification and treatment (both 
curative and preventive) of problems. 
However, further research is required 
before we can be certain that a robust 
framework exists with which to cope with 
individuals identified by the clinical 
prediction rule proposed above. 
8.11 
Outpatient appointments 
Every patient who has undergone 
imaging of their head and/or been 
admitted to hospital (that is, those 
initially deemed to be at high risk for 
clinically important brain injury) 
should be routinely referred to their 
General Practitioner for follow-up 
within a week after discharge.  
When a person who has undergone 
imaging of the head and/or been",137,LEFT,238,Page 137 (LEFT)
chunk_137_RIGHT,"admitted to hospital experiences 
persisting problems, there should be 
an opportunity available for referral 
from primary care to an out-patient 
appointment with a professional 
trained in assessment and 
management of sequelae of brain 
injury (for example, clinical 
psychologist, neurologist, 
neurosurgeon, specialist in 
rehabilitation medicine).  
These recommendations are based on 
level five evidence and are considered 
to be grade D recommendations. 
8.12 
Prognosis in severe head injury 
A recent systematic review focusing only 
on severe head injuries examined 
evidence on early indicators of 
prognosis.154 The review found that 
certain variables had a high positive 
predictive value for poor prognosis.  
While this level one evidence is useful in 
identifying patients at highest risk for 
poor outcome, it is unclear what course 
of action should be pursued with these 
patients. Guidelines on the rehabilitation 
of adults following traumatic brain injury 
have been prepared by the British 
Society of Rehabilitation Medicine. These 
are based on a full systematic review of 
the literature as well as drawing on the 
recommendations of existing consensus 
documents. The guidelines were 
published in December 2003155 and 
include information on the rehabilitation 
of patients following acquired brain 
injury. The contents of this guideline are 
therefore beyond the scope of this 
guideline.",137,RIGHT,201,Page 137 (RIGHT)

8.13 
Advice about long term problems and 
support services 
[Amended] All patients and their 
carers should be made aware of the 
possibility of long-term symptoms and 
disabilities following head injury and 
should be made aware of the 
existence of services that they could 
contact if they experience long-term 
problems. Details of support services 
should be included on patient 
discharge advice cards.  
This recommendation is based on level 
five evidence and is considered to be a 
grade D recommendation. 
8.14 
Communication with community services 
A communication (letter or email) 
should be generated for all patients 
who have attended the emergency 
department with a head injury, and 
sent to the patient’s GP within 1 week 
of the end of the hospital episode. This 
letter should include details of the 
clinical history and examination. This 
letter should be open to the person or 
their carer, or a copy should be given 
to them.  
[Amended] A communication (letter or 
email) should be generated for all 
school-aged children who received 
head or cervical spine imaging, and 
sent to the relevant GP and school 
nurse within 1 week of the end of the 
hospital episode. This letter should 
include details of the clinical history 
and examination.  
[Amended] A communication (letter or 
email) should be generated for all preschool children who received head or",138,LEFT,234,Page 138 (LEFT)

GP and health visitor within 1 week of 
the end of the hospital episode. This 
letter should include details of the 
clinical history and examination.  
These recommendations are based on 
level five evidence and are considered 
to be grade D recommendations. 
8.15 
Re-attendees 
There is evidence that patients who reattend in the days immediately after 
head injury are a high risk group for 
intracranial complications.156 
Patients who returned to an emergency 
department within 48 hours of 
discharge with any persistent 
complaint relating to the initial head 
injury should be seen by or discussed 
with a senior clinician experienced in 
head injuries, and considered for a CT 
scan.  
This recommendation is based on level 
two evidence and is considered a 
grade B recommendation.",138,RIGHT,129,Page 138 (RIGHT)

Admission and observation
9.1 
Introduction 
These guidelines place the emphasis on 
the early diagnosis of clinically 
important brain and cervical spine 
injuries, using a sensitive and specific 
clinical decision rule with early imaging. 
Admission to hospital is intrinsically 
linked to imaging results, on the basis 
that patients who do not require imaging 
are safe for discharge to the community 
(given that no other reasons for 
admission exist) and those who do 
require imaging can be discharged 
following negative imaging (again, 
given that no other reasons for 
admission exist). However, observation 
of patients will still form an important 
part of the acute management phase, 
for patients with abnormal CT results 
that do not require surgery and/or for 
patients with unresolved neurological 
signs.  Observation should occur 
throughout the patient’s hospital 
episode, whether in the emergency 
department or after admission following 
abnormal imaging results. As noted 
above, all care professionals should use 
a standard head injury proforma in their 
documentation when assessing and 
observing patients with head injury.  
Separate adult, and child/infant specific 
proformas should be used. Again, the",139,LEFT,194,Page 139 (LEFT)
chunk_139_RIGHT,"adult and paediatric GCS and derived 
scores should form the basis of 
observation, supplemented by other 
important observations. 
An important result of these guidelines 
will be that the typical patient admitted 
for in hospital observation after head 
injury will have a more severe profile. It 
is presumed that the guidelines will lead 
to a substantially lower number of 
patients requiring admission, but these 
patients will have either confirmed 
abnormal imaging, have failed to return 
to normal consciousness or have other 
continuing signs and symptoms of 
concern to the clinician. The emphasis will 
shift therefore from vigilance for 
possible deterioration, to active care of 
patients where an ongoing head injury 
complication has been confirmed.

Admission

for admission to hospital following a

Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
- Patients with new, clinically 
significant abnormalities on imaging. 
- Patients who have not returned to 
GCS equal to 15 after imaging, 
regardless of the imaging results. 
- When a patient fulfils the criteria for 
CT scanning but this cannot be done 
within the appropriate period, either 
because CT is not available or because 
the patient is not sufficiently 
cooperative to allow scanning. 
- Continuing worrying signs (for 
example, persistent vomiting, severe 
headaches) of concern to the clinician. 
- Other sources of concern to the 
clinician (for example, drug or alcohol 
intoxication, other injuries, shock, 
suspected non-accidental injury, 
meningism, cerebrospinal fluid leak). 
[Amended] Some patients may require 
an extended period in a recovery 
setting because of the use of general 
anaesthesia during CT imaging.  
Patients with multiple injuries should 
be admitted under the care of the team 
that is trained to deal with their most

These recommendations are based on 
level five evidence and are considered 
to be grade D recommendations. 
9.3 
Good practice in observation of patients 
with head injury 
There is some evidence that Emergency 
Deparment observation wards are more 
efficient than general acute wards at 
dealing with short stay observation",140,LEFT,214,Page 140 (LEFT)
chunk_140_RIGHT,"patients, with more senior supervision, 
fewer tests and shorter stays.157 There 
have also been concerns about the 
experience and skills of staff on general 
and orthopaedic acute wards in head 
injury care.12 This lead to a 
recommendation by the Royal College 
of Surgeons of England in 1999 that 
adult patients needing a period of 
observation should be admitted to a 
dedicated observation ward within or 
adjacent to an emergency department.12 
[Amended] In circumstances where a 
patient with a head injury requires 
hospital admission, it is recommended 
that the patient be admitted only under 
the care of a team led by a consultant 
who has been trained in the 
management of this condition during 
his/her higher specialist training. The 
consultant and his/her team should 
have competence (defined by local 
agreement with the neuroscience unit) 
in assessment, observation and 
indications for imaging (see 
recommendations 3.7); inpatient 
management; indications for transfer 
to a neuroscience unit (see 
recommendations 3.6); and hospital 
discharge and follow up (see 
recommendations 3.8).  
It is recommended that in-hospital 
observation of patients with a head 
injury should only be conducted by 
professionals competent in the 
assessment of head injury. 
These recommendations are based on 
level five evidence and are considered 
to be grade D recommendations.",140,RIGHT,205,Page 140 (RIGHT)

Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
The service configuration and training 
arrangements required to ensure this 
occurs are beyond the scope of these 
guidelines but it is hoped that this issue 
will be addressed by future NHS policy 
guidance. 
9.4 
Minimum documented observations 
For patients admitted for head injury 
observation the minimum acceptable 
documented neurological observations 
are: GCS; pupil size and reactivity; 
limb movements; respiratory rate; 
heart rate; blood pressure; 
temperature; blood oxygen saturation. 
This recommendation is based on level 
five evidence and is considered to be a 
grade D recommendation. 
9.5 
Frequency of observations 
As the risk of an intracranial 
complication is highest in the first 6 hours 
after a head injury, observations should 
have greatest frequency in this 
period.158 
Observations should be performed 
and recorded on a half-hourly basis 
until GCS equal to 15 has been 
achieved. The minimum frequency of 
observations for patients with GCS 
equal to 15 should be as follows, 
starting after the initial assessment in 
the emergency department: 
- half-hourly for 2 hours; 
- then 1-hourly for 4 hours; 
- then 2-hourly thereafter. 
Should a patient with GCS equal to 15 
deteriorate at any time after the initial",141,LEFT,205,Page 141 (LEFT)
chunk_141_RIGHT,"2-hour period, observations should 
revert to half-hourly and follow the 
original frequency schedule. 
These recommendations are based on 
level five evidence and are considered 
to be grade D recommendations. 
9.6 
Patient changes requiring review while 
under observation 
 [Amended] Any of the following 
examples of neurological deterioration 
should prompt urgent reappraisal by 
the supervising doctor: 
- Development of agitation or 
abnormal behaviour. 
- A sustained (that is, for at least 30 
minutes) drop of one point in GCS 
(greater weight should be given to a 
drop of one point in the motor 
response score of the Glasgow Coma 
Scale). 
- Any drop of three or more points in 
the eye-opening or verbal response 
scores of the Glasgow Coma Scale, or 
two or more points in the motor 
response score.  
- Development of severe or increasing 
headache or persisting vomiting. 
- New or evolving neurological 
symptoms or signs such as pupil 
inequality or asymmetry of limb or 
facial movement. 
To reduce inter-observer variability 
and unnecessary referrals, a second 
member of staff competent to perform 
observation should confirm 
deterioration before involving the",141,RIGHT,179,Page 141 (RIGHT)

supervising doctor. This confirmation 
should be carried out immediately. 
Where a confirmation cannot be 
performed immediately (for example, 
no staff member available to perform 
the second observation) the 
supervising doctor should be contacted 
without the confirmation being 
performed. 
These recommendations are based on 
level five evidence and are considered 
to be a grade D recommendation. 
9.7 
Imaging following confirmed patient 
deterioration during observation 
[Amended] If any of the changes 
noted in recommendation 1.7.5.1 are 
confirmed, an immediate CT scan 
should be considered, and the 
patient’s clinical condition should be 
re-assessed and managed 
appropriately.  
This recommendation is based on level 
five evidence and is considered to be a 
grade D recommendation. 
9.8 
Further imaging if GCS equal to 15 not 
achieved at 24 hours 
In the case of a patient who has had a 
normal CT scan but who has not 
achieved GCS equal to 15 after 24 
hours observation, a further CT scan or 
MRI scanning should be considered 
and discussed with the radiology 
department. 
This recommendation is based on level 
five evidence and is considered to be a 
grade D recommendation.",142,LEFT,199,Page 142 (LEFT)
chunk_142_RIGHT,"9.9 
Observation of children and infants 
Observation of infants and young 
children (that is, aged under 5 years) is 
a difficult exercise and therefore 
should only be performed by units 
with staff experienced in the 
observation of infants and young 
children with a head injury. Infants 
and young children may be observed 
in normal paediatric observation 
settings, as long as staff have the 
appropriate experience. 
This recommendation is based on level 
five evidence and is considered to be a 
grade D recommendation. 
9.10 
Training in observation 
Medical, nursing and other staff caring 
for patients with head injury admitted 
for observation should all be capable 
of performing the observations listed 
in 9.4 and 9.6 above.  
The acquisition and maintenance of 
observation and recording skills 
require dedicated training and this 
should be available to all relevant 
staff.  
Specific training is required for the 
observation of infants and young 
children. 
This recommendation is based on level 
five evidence and is considered to be a 
grade D recommendation. 
9.11 
Support for families and carers 
Early support can help the patient’s 
family or carer(s) prepare for the 
effects of head injury. This support can 
reduce the psychological sequelae",142,RIGHT,193,Page 142 (RIGHT)

experienced by the family or carer and 
result in better long term outcomes for 
both the patient and their family. 
Patient’s family members can find the 
hospital acute care setting overwhelming 
and this can cause additional tension or 
stress. It can be a particularly traumatic 
experience for a child visiting a sibling 
or parent with a head injury.   
There should be a protocol for all staff 
to introduce themselves to family 
members or carers and briefly explain 
what they are doing. In addition a 
photographic board with the names 
and titles of personnel in the hospital 
departments caring for patients with 
head injury can be helpful. 
Information sheets detailing the nature 
of head injury and any investigations 
likely to be used should be available 
in the emergency department. The 
patient version of these NICE 
guidelines may be helpful. 
Staff should consider how best to 
share information with children and 
introduce them to the possibility of 
long term complex changes in their 
parent or sibling. Literature produced 
by patient support groups may be 
helpful.  
These recommendations are based on 
level five evidence and are considered 
to be grade D recommendations. 
The presence of familiar friends and 
relatives at the early stage following 
admission can be very helpful. The 
patient recovering consciousness can 
easily be confused by strange faces and 
the strange environment in which they",143,LEFT,241,Page 143 (LEFT)
chunk_143_RIGHT,"find themselves. Relatives or carers are 
often willing to assist with simple tasks 
which, as well as helping nursing staff, 
helps families to be part of the recovery 
process rather than just an observer. 
[Amended] Healthcare professionals 
should encourage carers and relatives 
to talk and make physical contact (for 
example, holding hands) with the 
patient. However, it is important that 
relatives and friends do not feel 
obliged to spend long peiods at the 
bedside. If they wish to stay with the 
patient, they should be encouraged to 
take regular breaks.  
This recommendation is based on level 
five evidence and is considered to be a 
grade D recommendation. 
Voluntary support groups can speak 
from experience about the real life 
impact post head injury and can offer 
support following discharge from 
hospital. This is particularly important 
where statutory services are lacking. 
There should be a board or area 
displaying leaflets or contact details 
for patient support organisations either 
locally or nationally to enable family 
members to gather further information. 
This recommendation is based on level 
five evidence and is considered to be a 
grade D recommendation.",143,RIGHT,184,Page 143 (RIGHT)

10 Medical radiation
10.1 
Introduction 
The medical use of radiation for 
diagnosis and therapy is the largest 
source of radiation exposure to humans 
outside natural background radiation. 
The main diagnostic sources of radiation 
are X-ray examinations, particularly 
those involving CT.  Magnetic Resonance 
Imaging does not involve ionising 
radiation.Recent advances in CT 
technology, particularly the advent of 
multislice helical CT, have led to 
dramatic improvements in image quality 
and speed of acquisition. These have 
resulted in more clinical applications for 
CT imaging and an explosive growth in 
the number of CT examinations 
performed in countries that have access 
to this technology. The radiation doses 
received by the patient remain 
considerably larger for CT compared to 
conventional X-ray imaging, but dosesaving features introduced into the latest 
scanners and the adoption of more 
optimised scanning protocols have led to 
small reductions in patient dose for some 
CT examinations over the past few 
years. In 1998 CT examinations 
accounted for 4% of all X-ray imaging 
procedures in the UK and contributed",144,LEFT,184,Page 144 (LEFT)
chunk_144_RIGHT,"40% of the collective dose to the 
population.159 By 2002 these figures 
had risen to 7% and 47% 
respectively.160         
National patient dose surveys for CT 
examinations have been carried out in 
the UK in 1989161 and in 2003162. Both 
surveys show significant variations in 
patient dose across the country for the 
same CT examination, by factors of 10 
to 40, due to differences in scanner 
design and institutional-specific 
examination techniques. There 
consequently still appears to be 
considerable scope for standardising 
examination techniques to protect the 
patient from unnecessary exposure 
without reduction in image quality. 
Patient doses were generally lower by 
10-40% in the 2003 survey compared 
to 1989. Lowering patient dose is 
possible with adjustments of scan 
technique, tube current and filtration 
factors, alterations in pitch, and image 
reconstruction parameters163-165. 
Increased awareness of these dosereduction techniques has probably led to 
better-optimised scan protocols being 
used in the later survey. Automatic tube",144,RIGHT,151,Page 144 (RIGHT)
chunk_145_LEFT,"152
 
Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
current modulation according to the 
thickness and density of the part of the 
patient being scanned, is also helping to 
reduce doses in the latest CT scanners.   
10.2 
Patient doses from head CT 
Specific dosimetry techniques and dose 
quantities have been developed for 
measuring patient radiation exposure. 
To relate the exposures to the risk of 
radiation-induced cancer (or deleterious 
hereditary effects), an estimate of the 
absorbed dose to a number of 
radiosensitive organs or tissues in the 
body is required.  
The absorbed dose to an organ or tissue 
dose, usually expressed in milligray 
(mGy), reflects the energy deposited by 
X-rays per gram of irradiated body 
tissue, averaged over the particular 
organ or tissue. 
The effective dose, usually expressed in 
millisieverts (mSv), is a calculated 
weighted sum of organ doses that takes 
into account organ differences in radiosensitivity and is a useful comparative 
index related to the total radiationinduced cancer risks from varying 
radiological procedures. 
The latest UK CT patient dose survey162 
shows the typical effective dose from a 
routine head CT examination on adults 
to be 1.5 mSv. This remains much the 
same for examinations on 10 year old 
and 5 year old children but rises to 
about 2.5 mSv for examinations on 
babies (0-1 years old). In comparison to 
conventional X-ray examinations of the 
skull with a typical effective dose of 
0.06 mSv166, CT head examinations",145,LEFT,244,Page 145 (LEFT)
chunk_145_RIGHT,"involve about 25 times more radiation 
exposure. In the 1998 UK survey, the 
eyes, thyroid and breasts typically 
received doses of about 50 mGy, 2 
mGy and 0.03 mGy, respectively, from 
a head CT scan161. Since the effective 
dose for a CT head scan has come down 
by about 20% between the 1989 and 
2003 surveys, these organ doses have 
probably seen a similar reduction.  
For comparison, the average natural 
background radiation level in the UK 
gives rise to an annual effective dose of 
2.2 mSv, with regional averages ranging 
from 1.5 mSv to 7.5 mSv per year. 
10.3 
Patient doses from cervical spine CT 
A small proportion of patients are 
currently deemed suitable for CT 
examination of the cervical spine, usually 
carried out in conjunction with CT of the 
head.  Unfortunately cervical spine scans 
were not included in the 2003 patient 
dose survey but the mean value for the 
effective dose on adult patients 
receiving CT of the cervical spine in the 
1989 UK national survey 161 was 2.6 
mSv. This compares to 1.8 mSv for CT of 
the head alone in the 1989 survey.  The 
effective dose for cervical spine CT is 
higher because the thyroid is directly 
irradiated (mean thyroid dose equal to 
44 mGy). NRPB models167 indicate that 
the effective dose received by children 
and infants from head and neck CT 
scans is higher, if the scan parameters 
are unchanged from those used on adult 
patients. The increase amounts to a 
factor of 2.3 for newborns, a factor of 
1.5 for 5 year olds and a factor of 1.2 
for 10 year olds. These factors 
emphasise the need to match the scan",145,RIGHT,276,Page 145 (RIGHT)
chunk_146_LEFT,"153

parameters to the size of the patient. 
The doses involved for all age groups 
may now be smaller due to increased 
awareness of this need and the 
introduction of multislice helical CT, as 
has been seen for CT head scans. 
10.4 
Summary of effective doses from CT and 
conventional X-ray examinations of the 
head and cervical spine 
A summary of estimates of the effective 
doses received by adults, children and 
infants from CT and conventional 
radiographic examinations of the head 
and cervical spine are detailed in Table 
9.1 below. The estimates for CT head 
examinations are based on the 2003 
survey161 and reflect UK practice at that 
time for selecting CT scan parameters 
for adult and paediatric patients. The 
estimates for CT cervical spine 
examinations are based on the 1989 
survey for adult patients and paediatric 
enhancement factors that assume that 
the same CT technique parameters are 
used for children and adults (which has 
been common practice until recently). 
They consequently are likely to 
overestimate patient doses from current 
practice.   
The estimates for conventional 
radiographic examinations are based 
on typical effective doses for adults in a 
further NRPB survey166. 
Effective doses for children from these 
radiographic examinations have been 
assumed to be the same as those for 
adults, since the technique parameters 
are usually adapted to the size of the 
patient.",146,LEFT,238,Page 146 (LEFT)

10.5 
Cancer risks 
The risk of radiation-induced 
malignancies from a single CT exposure 
is difficult to assess.  There have been no 
published epidemiological studies of 
increased incidence of cancer among CT 
exposed patients. Current estimates of 
the risks from medical X-rays are based 
on  the long term follow up of 
populations exposed to large doses of 
radiation.168 The 1990 recommendations 
of the International Commission on 
Radiological Protection (ICRP) report a 
nominal probability coefficient of 5% 
per Sv effective dose for the lifetime risk 
of fatal cancer in a population of all 
ages and both sexes exposed to 
radiation at the relatively low doses 
used in CT examinations. 169   
The lifetime fatal cancer risk will vary 
with age at exposure and sex and the 
way that it does so varies from organ to 
organ. As a rough guide, assuming 
uniform whole body irradiation, the 
NRPB estimates that the lifetime risk for 
radiation-induced cancer per unit dose is 
about twice as high in children (0-15 
years old) than in adults (20-60 years 
old)170. This would put the lifetime risk of 
fatal cancer following exposures in 
childhood at about 10% per Sv 
effective dose, compared to about 5% 
per Sv for exposures to adults between 
20 and 60 years old.  The risks drop 
dramatically at ages above 60 years 
due mostly to the reduced lifetime 
available in which these delayed effects 
of radiation can occur. 
More specifically, Brenner et al 
estimated that the lifetime cancer",148,LEFT,259,Page 148 (LEFT)
chunk_148_RIGHT,"mortality risks from CT examinations on 
a one-year-old child are approximately 
an order of magnitude higher than the 
risks for CT-scanned adults.171This is due 
to both an increased dose for children 
having CT scans in the USA at the time 
(2001) compared to adults, and an 
estimated increase in risk per unit dose 
of about a factor of 3 for a one year 
old child. While this paper calculates a 
projected 500 additional cancer deaths 
per year in the USA from the number of 
paediatric CT examinations performed 
in 2001, this only represents a 0.35% 
increase in the background cancer death 
rate.  
In summary, the best available evidence 
suggests that paediatric CT will result in 
increased lifetime risks of cancer 
compared to adult CT due to both the 
higher radiation doses currently 
delivered to children and their increased 
sensitivity to radiation-induced cancer 
over a longer life span. 
10.6 
Radiation exposure management 
In line with good radiation exposure 
practice every effort should be made to 
minimise radiation dose during 
imaging of the head and cervical 
spine, while ensuring that image 
quality and coverage is sufficient to 
achieve an adequate diagnostic study.  
In spite of the potential risks of 
increased radiation exposure as a 
result of these guidelines, the 
consensus opinion of the Guideline 
Development Group is that this is 
justified by the increased effectiveness 
in identifying and managing patients 
with significant brain injuries.",148,RIGHT,232,Page 148 (RIGHT)

Economic evaluation
11.1 
Introduction 
The explicit use of economic evaluation 
in clinical guideline development is a 
recent but international phenomenon. In 
the USA, the Committee on Clinical 
Practice Guidelines has recommended 
that every clinical guideline include cost 
information for alternative patient 
management strategies.172 In the UK, the 
remit of NICE is to produce national 
clinical guidelines that address costeffectiveness as well as clinical 
effectiveness. 
The reasoning behind the application of 
economic criteria to clinical guidelines is 
that no health system anywhere in the 
world has enough resources to provide 
every potentially beneficial 
preventative, diagnostic, curative and 
palliative procedure. Therefore, there is 
a need to re-deploy resources to those 
procedures where the potential health 
gain is greatest. This requires 
abandoning practices that are relatively 
poor value for money. 
There is a well-developed 
methodological literature for assessing 
the relative cost-effectiveness (value for 
money) of different healthcare",150,LEFT,162,Page 150 (LEFT)
chunk_150_RIGHT,"procedures.173-175 There is still some 
debate over some of the specific 
methods of economic evaluation in 
healthcare but essentially there are six  
steps to evaluating the relative 
efficiency of any procedure. 
1. Identify the target group (for 
example, patients attending emergency 
departments with GCS greater than 12), 
the procedure to be evaluated (for 
example, head CT scanning) and its 
alternative strategy (for example, skull 
X-ray). 
2. Identify all the important health and 
resource outcomes that are likely to 
differ between the procedure and its 
alternative. 
3. Measure the differences in identified 
health and resource outcomes. 
4. Estimate the value of the health gain 
and the value of the resource use.  
(Resource use is valued in terms of its 
monetary value, its economic cost.  
Health gain is sometimes valued in 
monetary terms but more often a nonpecuniary measure such as the qualityadjusted life-year, QALY, is used).",150,RIGHT,145,Page 150 (RIGHT)
chunk_151_LEFT,"158
 
Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
5. Estimate the ratio of net health gain to 
net resource cost (for example, the cost 
per QALY gained) and compare this 
with the ratios estimated for other 
commonly used health programmes to 
assess its relative efficiency. The 
estimation of net health gain and net 
cost requires some kind of model (such 
as a decision analysis) to combine 
probability and outcome information. 
6. Consider the robustness of the costeffectiveness estimate in terms of 
statistical precision and generalisability 
to other settings. 
Ideally one would repeat each of these 
steps for each procedure considered 
within the guideline (and within each 
procedure, for each relevant patient 
subgroup). This would allow us to see for 
which group of patients the procedure is 
good value for money. In practice we 
are limited by the availability of data. 
11.2 
Methods 
The guideline development group 
identified two main areas where the 
potential impact of alternative strategies 
could be substantial. 
x Diagnosis of life-threatening important 
brain injuries in patients with minor head 
injury 
x Identifying cervical spine damage in 
patients with head injury. 
A third area, identification of patients 
most likely to experience long term 
sequelae, was also considered for 
economic evaluation. However, the lack 
of satisfactory clinical decision rules in 
this area means that this area remains",151,LEFT,227,Page 151 (LEFT)
chunk_151_RIGHT,"an issue only on the research agenda at 
this time. 
UPDATE 2007: 
For both of the identified areas, a 
review of the literature was conducted 
followed by simple economic modelling 
of the cost-effectiveness in England and 
Wales of different strategies.  The costs 
in these models were updated to 20056 prices for the 2007 update and the 
evidence summaries were modified 
accordingly. 
A full literature review for the 
rehabilitation question was not 
conducted during the 2007 update 
either. The list of the relevant papers 
retrieved can be found in 8.10.3 
A fourth area was added during the 
2007 update – the issue of which 
patients can bypass the nearest 
emergency department and go straight 
to a neurosciences centre from the scene 
of injury – see 11.6. 
11.2.1 Literature review 
Using the same search strategy as for 
the main systematic reviews but with an 
additional filter to locate costing 
information, a search (Appendix 1) was 
performed of: 
x Medline (PubMED) 
x Embase 
x Health Economic Evaluations Database 
(HHED) - http://www.ohe-heed.com.",151,RIGHT,168,Page 151 (RIGHT)

Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
x NHS Economic Evaluations Database 
(NHS EED) - 
http://nhscrd.york.ac.uk/nhsdhp.htm. 
These strategies were designed to find 
any economic study related to head 
injury. Abstracts and database reviews 
of papers found were reviewed by the 
health economist and were discarded if 
they appeared not to contain any 
economic data or if the focus of the 
paper was not imaging after trauma.  
Relevant references in the 
bibliographies of reviewed papers were 
also identified and reviewed. 
11.2.2 
Modelling of cost-effectiveness – 
intracranial haematoma 
A cost analysis was performed for the 
use of CT scanning on patients who have 
minor/mild head injury (that is, GCS 
greater than 12) but some loss of 
consciousness or amnesia at the time of 
the impact or thereafter. The reason for 
selecting this group is that it is assumed 
that those patients with a more 
significant loss of consciousness receive 
CT scanning automatically or are 
referred to neurosurgery. It is assumed 
that those who do not experience loss of 
consciousness or amnesia will not receive 
CT scanning. These assumptions mirror 
the methods used to derive the 
Canadian CT-head rule. 
Four alternative strategies were selected 
for the model (Table 11.1). The first is 
an approximation of the current (pre2003) UK system, based on skull X-ray 
for patients who have experienced loss 
of consciousness or amnesia. The second 
and third are the Canadian head rules, 
which avoid skull X-ray, but allow",152,LEFT,246,Page 152 (LEFT)
chunk_152_RIGHT,"greater access to CT scanning. Patients 
with a negative CT scan would be 
discharged. The fourth strategy is

* Stiell et al25 propose discharging patients that have a negative CT scan, although they are only 
half way through their validation study, which applies this strategy. This figure is based on their 
prevalence of complications. 
 
Stiell et al have not yet put their model into practice; therefore the admission rate figure is 
provisional. For this model it was assumed that only those with a positive CT scan (ICH or other 
complication) would be admitted. Another problem was that Stiell et al had already excluded 
patients without any loss of consciousness or amnesia, whereas the UK paper had not. This 
problem was tackled by assuming that patients in the UK study who were discharged without a 
skull X-ray or CT scan were also very low risk (that is, had no loss of consciousness or amnesia). 
11.2.3 Modelling of cost-effectiveness – cervical spine injuries 
We compared the cost of the two alternative strategies identified as being derived using 
relatively high quality methods: 
x 
NEXUS study rule 122 
x 
Canadian cervical spine rule 52 
These systems evaluate all patients with head trauma, the same cohort as for the intracranial 
haematoma model. 
The expected cost for each strategy was calculated on the basis of the expected usage of 
cervical spine X-ray, and cervical spine CT scan. It was not possible to quantify differences in 
health outcomes and other cost outcomes (Table 11.4, outcomes 3-8). Usage figures were derived 
from the original studies.  In the case of the Canadian cervical spine rule, there has not been a 
validation study hence the figures are from the original derivation study. It was assumed that, for 
both strategies, 39% of X-rays are inadequate 122 and that these are followed up with a CT 
scan.",154,LEFT,363,Page 154 (LEFT)

using the median cost of an excess bed day for a ‘Head injury without significant brain injury: 
uncomplicated’.

The NHS reference cost database contains accounting cost data from every NHS hospital trust. 
Each trust reports an average cost per hospital episode, categorised by type of visit (for 
example, out-patient, elective in-patient, etc) clinical specialty and Healthcare Resource Group 
(HRG). Accounting practices do vary between hospitals but the costs should reflect the full cost of 
the service (including direct, indirect and overhead costs), as described in the NHS Costing 
Manual.  
Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the sensitivity of the results to the model parameters: 
x for the unit costs, the inter-quartile range was used,  
x for the probabilities, the confidence intervals were used. 
11.3 
Diagnosis of intracranial haematoma in patients with a minor/mild head injury 
CT represents the gold standard in the diagnosis of intracranial haematoma following head 
injury. However, the number of CT scanners and trained staff in the NHS is limited and the cost of 
testing substantial. Therefore CT scanning in the NHS is currently restricted mainly to those with 
significant loss of consciousness (either on arrival or after deterioration) and those with a skull 
fracture, as diagnosed through skull X-ray. The question arises as to whether CT scanning would 
be cost-effective (that is, value for money) if extended to a larger group of patients. 
11.3.1 
Literature review 
Six studies have evaluated the overall impact of different diagnostic testing strategies for 
patients with minor/mild head injury. The UK studies date back to the early 1980s (pre-CT 
scanning) and advocate that both skull X-ray and in-patient observation be reduced to save 
costs.178-180 
Three overseas studies have compared CT scanning with alternative strategies.  Ingebrigtsen and 
Romner 181 found that in-patient observation was not necessary with CT. Therefore CT screening 
was less costly than skull X-ray screening in Norway because it reduced in-patient stays. 
Shackford et al 182 and Stein et al 183 had already come to the same conclusion for the USA.  
However, Stein et al also considered the potential use of X-ray screening without in-patient 
observation and not surprisingly found this to be the least costly strategy. 
Essentially all three studies have concluded that a system of CT scanning high risk patients 
followed by discharge after a negative CT scan is less costly than skull X-ray and admission for 
all of these patients. However, this comparison is not strictly relevant to the context of England 
and Wales because the current system does not admit all patients. 
The published evidence from the six studies is not ideal because: 
x the resource use and cost for CT scanning is not specific to the UK NHS context or is dated; and",156,LEFT,448,Page 156 (LEFT)
chunk_157_LEFT,"164
 
Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
x they have sought to quantify and cost outcomes 1-3 only. For example, the studies did not 
measure the cost savings and health gain associated with early diagnosis. Stein et al suggested 
that for those patients who are not diagnosed early there are lost wages and increased costs 
relating to in-patient stay, rehabilitation, treatment, medication and orthotic devices. 
Additional evidence retrieved in 2007 can be found below in 11.3.7. 
11.3.2 
Cost-effectiveness model – imaging of the head 
Using the unit costs and frequencies of testing, the cost per patient of each strategy is shown in 
Table 11.6. The least cost strategy is the 5-point Canadian CT Head rule. Although the cost of CT 
scanning is higher than for the current (pre-2003) UK system, the extra cost is more than offset by 
the reduction in skull X-rays and admissions.

Both Canadian rules could save the NHS money. It would require investment in additional CT 
scanning facilities but these costs would, be offset by the freeing up of ward space and X-ray 
capacity. 
These results were largely insensitive to the unit costs and probabilities used (Table 11.7). Only 
when both costs and probabilities were set to favour the current (pre-2003) UK system was the 
Canadian seven point rule more costly.",157,LEFT,277,Page 157 (LEFT)

This cost analysis was limited because the frequency of testing and admission for each strategy 
could only be estimated approximately given the currently available data. The Canadian head 
rule is less costly than the current (pre-2003) UK system because it is assumed that it reduces the 
number of admissions. In fact Stiell et al 25 have not yet put their model into practice, therefore 
the admission rate figure is provisional. For this model it was assumed that only those with a 
positive CT scan (ICH or other complication) would be admitted.  If the number of admissions were 
somewhat higher then this strategy would not be the least cost strategy. Assuming all other 
parameters in the model remain the same, the five point Canadian head rule is least cost if it 
reduces in-patient admissions by at least 37%. The seven point Canadian head rule appears to 
be more expensive even if admissions were entirely eliminated. 
Another model parameter which was estimated very approximately was the level of CT use in the 
current system, because CT scanning use was lower during the Nee et al (1993) study than in the 
present UK system. 
The sensitivity of the results to these particular assumptions is presented in a two-way sensitivity 
analysis (Table 11.8).",158,LEFT,331,Page 158 (LEFT)

* This scenario most closely approximates to the model’s base case. 
Another problem was that the study that presented data on the Canadian rules had already 
excluded patients without loss of consciousness or amnesia, whereas the UK paper had not – this 
problem was tackled by assuming that patients who were discharged did not receive a skull Xray.  Furthermore the analysis did not include outcomes 4-10 from Table 11.2. 
Evidence retrieved in 2007 provides real data on the impact of the Canadian head CT rule on 
the NHS - see below in 11.3.7.",159,LEFT,225,Page 159 (LEFT)
chunk_160_LEFT,"167
 
Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
11.3.3 
Health outcomes (4 and 5, see Table 
11.2) 
A strategy that increases NHS costs 
would be economically justified if there 
were associated health gains. Intuitively, 
we might expect surgical outcomes to 
improve if intracranial haematomas 
(ICHs) are detected earlier. There is no 
direct evidence that a strategy of CT 
scanning can improve neurosurgical 
outcomes although there is some 
evidence that outcomes have been 
improved in patients with more serious 
head injuries.184 
UPDATE 2007: 
However, there is cohort study evidence 
suggesting reduced mortality associated 
with prompt surgery185,186. A paper 
retrieved during the 2007 update76 had 
estimated the quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) gained from prompt surgery by 
comparing the recovery and mortality 
rates in different case series (see 11.3.7 
below).   
Any health gains associated with 
detection could be partially offset by 
increased cancer risk. There is no direct 
evidence that exposure to medical Xrays does increase the incidence of 
cancer, however, there is a general 
association between radiation and 
genetic mutation and it is clear that the 
exposure level is considerably higher 
with CT scanning than with skull X-ray 
(see Chapter 10). 
11.3.4 
Other health service costs (6, see Table 
11.2) 
The change in health outcomes just 
mentioned would lead to considerable",160,LEFT,217,Page 160 (LEFT)
chunk_160_RIGHT,"changes in health service resource use 
for the particular patients affected.  
However in both cases the net change in 
health service costs could go up or down. 
For example, if an improvement in 
neurosurgical outcome leads to more 
patients surviving but those that survive 
require long term care for chronic brain 
injury then costs would increase. 
Alternatively if both mortality and 
disability were reduced then long term 
costs are likely to be reduced.  
However, whichever direction the change 
is in, the average change in costs per 
patient scanned is likely to be small 
given the low likelihood of a change in 
health outcome. 
11.3.5 Patient costs (7&8, see Table 11.2) 
The costs (time, lost income, medication 
purchased, etc) to patients and their 
families associated with changes in 
health outcome could be considerable.  
As with health service costs we could not 
be certain what the net effect would be 
for the family. Again when averaged 
across all patients these cost changes 
could be quite small because the 
incidence of these changes in outcomes 
will be small. 
There may be substantial costs 
associated with the decision to admit but 
these are likely to differ according to 
the situation of the family. For example, 
if a parent is admitted then there might 
be a need for child-minders but on the 
other hand the act of regular 
observation at home is costly in itself 
and families might find it easier if this 
burden were undertaken by the hospital.",160,RIGHT,244,Page 160 (RIGHT)
chunk_161_LEFT,"168
 
Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
11.3.6 
Litigation costs (9, see Table 11.2) 
It has been suggested that litigation 
might be reduced if more patients were 
scanned. However, Bramley et al 187 
have estimated that only one in 10,000 
patients subsequently turn out to have an 
intracranial haematoma after being 
discharged without a CT. Therefore the 
potential costs saved per patient 
screened are likely to be small.  It should 
also be born in mind that successful 
litigation usually arises out of 
organisations not abiding by guidelines. 
11.3.7 
Update 2007 
We found three new studies that 
evaluated diagnostic tools: a decision 
analysis188 and an RCT79 were 
comparing admission with CT scanning, 
and a case series189 was evaluating the 
use of head MRI as an addition to CT.   
A further three new studies evaluated 
diagnostic decision rules. We found two 
studies evaluating the implementation of 
the head CT rule recommended in the 
original edition of this guideline. A third 
study compared the Canadian Head CT 
Rule with various imaging strategies. 
A decision analysis188 compared CT 
scanning (and discharge after a 
negative scan) with admission in head 
injury patients with a GCS of 15 (mild 
head injury). They found the CT strategy 
to be cost saving compared with 
admission. The same team confirmed the 
results of this study with a randomised 
controlled trial of 2600 mild head injury 
patients791. Outcomes were followed up 
for three months. There were no 
differences in clinical outcomes (survival 
and extended Glasgow Outcome scale",161,LEFT,257,Page 161 (LEFT)
chunk_161_RIGHT,"GOS) but costs were £133 less per 
patient in the CT arm. 
A retrospective case series of 40 
patients189 was used to evaluate the 
addition of an MRI to CT scanning in 
patients with traumatic brain injury. The 
number of lesions diagnosed by CT but 
not by MRI was 9 out of 40, while the 
lesions detected by MRI but not by CT 
were 24 out of 40. The addition of MRI 
cost more than £1,500 in additional 
charges per extra lesion diagnosed. 
However the identification of the 
additional lesions did not lead to a 
change in the treatment path and 
therefore the addition of MRI to CT was 
neither effective nor cost-effective. 
However, the cohort was small for 
estimating the effectiveness with any 
precision. 
A UK cohort study16 evaluated the 
consequences of implementing the NICE 
guideline. The X-ray and admissionbased practice was replaced with the 
Canadian CT head rule. Cases of head 
injury were followed up in a regional 
neurosciences hospital and in a district 
general hospital for one month, six 
months before and for one month after 
the guideline implementation. In the case 
of the neurosciences hospital the cost per 
patient was reduced by £34 and it was 
reduced by £3 per patient at the 
general hospital. In contrast in a similar 
cohort study88 of 992 patients, costs 
were found to increase by £77 per 
patient. Table 1 shows the resource use 
observed in both studies compared with 
the predictions in the original edition of 
this guideline. The evidence from the 
cohorts suggests that compared with our",161,RIGHT,259,Page 161 (RIGHT)

Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
predictions there was a more modest 
increase in CT and a more modest 
decrease in X-ray.   
The variation in impact between centres 
could be due to a number of factors 
including variation in the baseline 
position and completeness of adherence 
to the NICE guideline in the after period 
of the studies. In the centre that showed 
an increase in cost, X-rays were very 
low in number to start with and therefore 
there was less scope for cost savings; 
furthermore admissions had inexplicably 
increased slightly compared with the 
reductions seen at the other centres. The 
large amount of variation between 
centres means that the impact of our 
recommendations at a national level 
remains uncertain.",162,LEFT,130,Page 162 (LEFT)

Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
One of the centres in the Hassan study16 
had modified the protocol so that 
elderly patients with a GCS of 15 seen 
out of hours could be admitted instead 
of getting urgent CT. The reasoning 
involves a combination of factors: a) the 
cost of out-of-hours radiology was 
relatively high, b) the elderly represent 
quite a large group and there are often 
difficulties in trying to discharge them 
over night. Hence, the modification is 
lower cost since out-of-hours radiology is 
avoided and most would needed 
admission anyway.  We don’t have 
evidence of effectiveness for this specific 
patient group but the randomised 
evidence for the general population 
showed no difference in outcomes 
between observation and CT scan79. The 
GDG agreed that this was an 
acceptable deviation from the head rule 
and the guideline recommendations 
were modified accordingly. 
A decision analysis76compared the 
Canadian head CT rule with several 
strategies including ‘CT all’, ‘admit all’, 
‘discharge all’ and ‘X-ray all’ in a US 
context. Quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) and costs were estimated for 
both prompt and delayed surgery by 
comparing the mortality and recovery 
rates in different case series. The 
Canadian rule dominated the other 
strategies, that is to say it gave the 
highest number of QALYs and the lowest 
cost. However, the study did not 
evaluate the earlier UK guidelines 
based on skull X-ray and admission. The 
CT all strategy was just as clinically 
effective but more costly. The results 
were sensitive to the probability that",164,LEFT,259,Page 164 (LEFT)

Literature review 
There are three cost-effectiveness studies in this area: 
x Kaneriya et al 190 estimated that five view X-ray could save $24 per patient scanned 
compared with three-view because it reduced the number of subsequent CTs associated with 
inadequate X-rays by 48%.   
x Tan et al 191 estimated the cost-effectiveness of CT scan after inadequate X-ray. They found a 
cost of $16,900 per potentially (or definitely) unstable fracture and $50,600 per definitely 
unstable fracture. This is cost-effective given the consequences of paralysis. 
x Blackmore et al 121, using test sensitivities pooled from the published literature, compared CT 
scanning of the cervical spine with conventional cervical spine X-ray. Using their own risk rating 
scale, they found CT scanning to be a cost-effective strategy ($16,000 per quality-adjusted lifeyear gained) for the ‘high’ and ‘moderate’ risk groups (high energy mechanism and age under 
50 or moderate energy mechanism and age greater than 50) but not for the low risk group 
($84,000 per QALY gained).  Unlike the other studies, incorporated into these figures are the 
costs and morbidity associated with paralysis. 
x In addition, two more studies estimated the costs that could be saved by moving from current 
practice at a particular institution to a particular scanning protocol.122,192 
The above studies are not strictly relevant to the context of England and Wales, not least 
because the unit costs and the patient groups used in the studies are not from the UK. Furthermore 
they only attempted to include outcomes 1 and 2 (and in the case of Blackmore et al 4 and 6 as 
well) and crucially do not address the long term effects of medical radiation, which are likely to 
be greater in CT scanning of the neck than in CT scanning of the head (see Chapter 10). 
The Blackmore analysis suggests for a patient group that is at particularly high risk of paralysis, 
cervical spine CT could be preferable to X-ray by both improving health outcomes and lowering 
costs. However, they do not take into account the impact of the large radiation dose received by 
the thyroid from a cervical spine CT scan. This would be very difficult to model given the lack of 
empirical evidence on the long term effects of this medical radiation. It was the consensus of the 
Guideline Development Group that the benefits from CT scanning of the cervical spine do not 
obviously outweigh the risks.  
In light of the review of new clinical and cost-effectiveness evidence, the GDG modified its 
position to recommend CT scanning in high risk patients. Additional cost-effectiveness evidence 
retrieved in 2007 can be found below in 11.4.3.",165,LEFT,477,Page 165 (LEFT)

Cost-effectiveness model – imaging of the cervical spine 
We conducted our own tentative cost analysis comparing the NEXUS and the Canadian cervical 
spine rules. We estimated that the Canadian rule could save about £14 per patient (Table

The Canadian cervical spine rule could 
save valuable health service resources 
but it is yet to be validated and if it was 
found to be less sensitive it might not be 
the most cost-effective strategy due to 
the morbidity and high costs associated 
with paralysis. This cost analysis was 
limited because of the use of overseas 
data and the simplified assumptions 
regarding dealing with inadequate Xrays. Furthermore the analysis did not 
include outcomes 3-8 from Table 11.4. 
11.4.3 
Update 2007 
Five new studies were found: a nonrandomised controlled trial117, two 
cohort studies118,193, a case series119 and 
a decision model120. One study193 was 
evaluating the role of MRI scanning in 
children, another study 117 was 
comparing helical CT scanning with Xray in children, and the rest were 
comparing CT scanning with X-ray in 
adults.   
A non-RCT 117 compared the costs of 
helical CT with those of X-ray in a 
population of 136 children who required 
cervical spine radiography in addition to 
cranial CT. The imaging costs including 
follow-up tests were £100 and £130 
respectively for the radiography and CT 
diagnostic strategies (significance not 
reported).   
A retrospective cohort study 118 based 
on an adult population of 573 trauma 
patients undergoing spinal imaging (the 
proportion with head injury was not 
reported) compared the costs of helical 
CT with X-ray. Unlike the non-RCT, this 
study found the cost of CT was no 
greater than X-ray (£36 vs £35) due to",167,LEFT,253,Page 167 (LEFT)
chunk_167_RIGHT,"the staff time involved with CT being 
substantially less.    
In a case series study 119, 407 adult 
patients in a trauma centre underwent 
both X-ray and helical CT (again the 
proportion with head injury was not 
reported). The reference standard was 
represented by two radiologists 
independently reviewing both the HCT 
and plain X-ray results together with 
hospital case notes. The sensitivity 
yielded by X-ray was 45% while the 
sensitivity yielded by the helical CT 
intervention was 98%. The helical CT 
strategy was more costly than a 
strategy of helical CT after inadequate 
X-ray. From their figures, we calculate 
that this strategy costs an extra £7,300 
per fracture detected.  Using the model 
by Blackmore and colleagues121, as 
follows, we can see that this is highly 
cost-effective.  The model estimated that 
5% of fractures would lead to paralysis 
and that paralysis is associated with 16 
QALYs lost.  Hence £7,300 per fracture 
detected would translate to only £9,125 
per QALY gained and that is without 
taking in to account the considerable 
cost savings from averting paralysis. 
The decision analysis of helical CT vs Xray of the cervical spine in patients 
undergoing cranial CT for head injury 
by Grogan et al120 was based on an 
earlier model by Blackmore and 
colleagues121 looking at conventional CT 
vs X-ray. It considered only patients at 
medium and high risk: 
x Focal neuro-deficit or severe head 
injury or high energy impact, or",167,RIGHT,234,Page 167 (RIGHT)
chunk_168_LEFT,"175
 
Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
x Moderate energy impact and age 
more than 50 
Helical CT cost an additional £37,000 
per paralysis averted in this group. This 
would imply that the helical CT strategy 
is cost saving when the very high cost of 
treating paralysis is taken into account. 
A retrospective cohort study with a 
historical control published in 2002 193 
evaluated a protocol of MRI scanning 
patients whose cervical spine had not 
been cleared within 72 hours. The 
control strategy was not clearly defined. 
This study was conducted in a specific 
population of patients consisting of 102 
children (age 0 to 17) who were 
intubated at the time of hospital 
admission and who remained in the 
intensive care unit for at least 3 days. 
Among the 51 patients in the control 
group, 19 underwent MRI, whereas it 
was required for 31 patients in the postprotocol group.  
The MRI group had reduced hospital 
charges (£18,000 vs £24,000; 
significance not reported) attributable to 
reduced stay in hospital and in intensive 
care. However, sample variation and a 
general trend over time towards 
reduced stay might explain this 
difference. 
11.5 
Discussion 
A simple cost model demonstrates that 
some strategies that increase head CT 
scanning could potentially reduce costs if 
patients that have a negative scan are 
discharged without admission. However, 
there are health outcomes and some 
additional changes to resource use that",168,LEFT,241,Page 168 (LEFT)
chunk_168_RIGHT,"cannot be quantified using currently 
available data – notably those 
associated with the impact of radiation 
exposure. 
Table 11.12 (below) summarises the 
estimated changes in imaging and 
admission volumes and cost in England 
and Wales as a result of these 
guidelines. This is based on Tables 11.3, 
11.6 and 11.10 and assumes an 
incidence of 700,000 head injury 
attendees to emergency departments 
per year. 
We would like to emphasise the 
tentativeness of these estimates. There is 
uncertainty over these figures for a 
number of reasons. Data were taken 
from four different sources to estimate 
the number of scans (currently and with 
the new system). 25,52,122,176  Various 
assumptions had to be made to make 
the denominator of the estimates from 
these studies comparable. Some of the 
evidence was not from a UK population. 
Empirical studies found in the 2007 
update (Table 11.9) show great 
variation between centres and therefore 
help little to reduce the uncertainty 
about the numbers of each scan before 
and after the guideline. 
The reduction in skull X-rays is likely to 
be an overestimate, as some skull X-rays 
may still have to take place for nonaccidental injuries and other reasons. 
The reduction in in-patient observation is 
also uncertain. This assumes that 
clinicians are able to discharge patients 
who have had a negative CT scan. This 
will not be the case for patients who",168,RIGHT,225,Page 168 (RIGHT)

Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
The Canadian head CT rule, adopted by 
the consensus of the Guideline 
Development Group is expected to 
reduce costs. There are also likely to be 
improvements in quality of care. In the 
short term this will mean fewer patients 
being diagnosed on ‘deterioration’, 
patients getting reassurance sooner 
rather than later and hopefully 
improvements in long term outcomes 
(although this is not based on high 
quality evidence). If patient outcomes 
are improved then this in turn might lead 
to additional cost-savings. It was the 
decision of the Guideline Development 
Group that the potential benefits of 
adopting this rule are likely to outweigh 
the potential costs. 
The NEXUS cervical spine rule and the 
Royal College of Radiologists guidelines 
appear to be almost identical. Given 
this, on the basis of a simple cost model, 
the adoption of the Canadian cervical 
spine rule could save valuable health 
service resources. This rule is yet to be 
validated, however, and if it was found 
to be less sensitive it might not be the 
most cost-effective strategy due to the 
morbidity and high costs associated with 
paralysis. On the other hand, the thyroid 
is known to be susceptible to radiation 
damage and strategies that reduce the 
need for radiological examination of the 
neck may reduce subsequent morbidity 
and health service cost. 
Our simple analyses estimated an 
additional scanning cost of £17 per 
head trauma patient associated with 
adopting the Canadian head CT and a 
cost saving of £14 associated with 
adopting the Canadian cervical spine",171,LEFT,265,Page 171 (LEFT)
chunk_171_RIGHT,"rule. This suggests a combined impact of 
£31 saved per patient. For England and 
Wales, assuming an incidence of head 
injury of around 700,000 cases a year, 
of which 54% satisfy the criteria for 
scanning, a modest saving of £12.1m 
that could be reinvested in the health 
service would result. However, we should 
be very cautious about this figure. The 
longer term impact of changing imaging 
strategies on health outcomes and health 
service costs is even less certain. Staff 
shortages in radiology mean that 
implementation of these changes could 
take some time or else use up extra 
resources. Another reason why these cost 
savings might not be realised in the short 
term is that they are likely to require 
investment in new CT scanning 
equipment. 
It is probable that we have not taken 
into account fully the implementation 
costs of the guideline. To some extent 
this is true, as our remit does not include 
the details of implementation. For 
example, we acknowledge that full 
implementation of the guideline will 
require staff training, the cost of which 
we have not been in a position to 
quantify.   
It is also possible that the costs 
incorporated into our cost analyses do 
not reflect the real costs of the services. 
For example, the increased utilisation of 
CT scanners may necessitate the 
purchase of additional scanners, 
although the capital cost of CT scanners 
should be incorporated into the unit costs 
that we have used in our costeffectiveness model. There is also a 
possibility of the expansion of out of",171,RIGHT,254,Page 171 (RIGHT)
chunk_172_LEFT,"179
 
Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
hours practice, which may push up the 
unit cost of scanning. The shortage of 
radiology and radiography staff, 
especially those with appropriate 
experience in CT scanning of the head, 
may again mean that the real cost of 
increasing CT scanning is greater than 
our calculations would suggest or at 
least that implementation will have to be 
delayed. 
One issue raised throughout the 
guideline consensus process was the 
need for additional staff training at 
many levels. Achieving this goal, 
nationally, could require substantial 
resources, especially when shortages in 
specialist staff (for example, 
radiographers) are already constraining 
the system.194 
We have suggested a number of 
reasons in the guideline document why 
the cost savings we have predicted 
might not occur. These include: 
x in-patient observation may not be 
reduced despite the increase in CT 
scanning (evidence since 2003 is mixed 
– see Table 11.9);   
x cervical spine CT might be quite rare 
at present and therefore the reductions 
won’t take place; 
x some skull X-rays will still have to take 
place for penetrating injury and other 
reasons (for example, suspected nonaccidental injury); 
x we have postulated that the similarity 
between the NEXUS guidelines and 
those of the RCR suggests that the 
NEXUS study represents current practice",172,LEFT,221,Page 172 (LEFT)
chunk_172_RIGHT,"for cervical spine imaging in the UK. If 
this is not the case then a move to the 
Canadian cervical spine rule might not 
lead to cost savings. 
It is clear that the long term morbidity 
associated with injury to the head and 
cervical spine and the lack of evidence 
concerning suitable rehabilitation are a 
major problem. Not only does it reduce 
the quality of life for these individuals 
and their carers but also it places a 
substantial burden on society in general 
through time off work and social security 
payments.195 Hence the development of 
effective rehabilitation programmes 
should be placed high up the research 
agenda. 
The other elements of the guideline are 
probably more conservative and 
therefore the overall impact on health 
service resources is probably small 
although it remains uncertain. 
11.5.1 Conclusions from the 2007 update 
A randomised controlled trial has 
confirmed that to discharge patients with 
mild head injury (GCS15) after a 
negative CT scan, as recommended in 
this guideline, is both safe and cost 
saving.   
The impact of the Canadian CT rule as 
advocated in the original edition of this 
guideline has varied considerably but 
reassuringly in some centres it has 
reduced costs. A published model that 
took into account long term treatment 
costs and health consequences indicated 
that the Canadian head CT rule is more 
cost-effective than a number of 
alternative strategies based on CT, X-",172,RIGHT,231,Page 172 (RIGHT)
chunk_173_LEFT,"180

ray or admission. However, none of the 
evidence has taken into account the 
impact of the increased radiation 
exposure. 
Updating the costs to 2005-6 prices 
makes the Canadian CT head rule even 
more cost-effective, since the cost of 
imaging has fallen. 
A modification of the rule so that elderly 
patients with a GCS of 15 seen out of 
hours could be admitted instead of 
getting urgent CT is a safe strategy and 
could be cost saving for services where 
out of hours radiography costs are 
prohibitively high.   
The new studies add to existing 
evidence, in suggesting that CT scanning 
of the cervical spine is cost-effective in 
higher risk groups who are already 
undergoing head CT. However, none of 
these studies have taken into account the 
costs and health consequences 
associated with the increased radiation 
exposure – it is possible that CT is no 
longer cost-effective when these are 
taken into account. It is difficult to model 
the impact of radiation exposure on 
cost-effectiveness since there are a 
large number of uncertainties: a) the 
amount of radiation received at 
different parts of the body, b) the 
relationship between exposure and 
cancer, c) the types of cancer caused, d) 
the pattern of resource use in the 
diagnosis and treatment of the cancer, 
and e) the timing of cancer, treatment 
and death. Another limitation with 
regard to cervical spine imaging is that 
all the studies were conducted in the 
USA; the observed healthcare costs and",173,LEFT,259,Page 173 (LEFT)
chunk_173_RIGHT,"savings might not be transferable to a 
UK NHS setting.  As the cost of CT 
scanning, as with most medical care, is 
lower in the UK, if it is cost-effective in 
the USA then it is likely to be costeffective for the NHS.  However, the cost 
savings from paralysis care averted are 
also likely to be lower.

Addendum 2007  – Direct transport from

11.6.1 Literature review 
We did not find any cost-effectiveness 
evidence for this question but we did 
find two simulation models, which we will 
refer to as the London and Staffordshire 
models.  We have reviewed these 
models in some detail, as follows. 
11.6.2 London model 
The report196 summarises the findings of 
a review conducted by the London 
Severe Injury Working Group focusing 
on the Trauma services provided in 
London, including care, treatment and 
transfer of severely injured patients. 
Severe injury was defined as the need 
for Intensive Care.   
The analysis of the current service 
highlights some key issues:  
x high secondary referral rate (two 
thirds of the severely injured patients 
group),  
x evidence of problems associated with 
such transfers (adverse clinical events 
during transfer, delay to definitive 
intervention, low level of staff and 
standard of care), and",173,RIGHT,207,Page 173 (RIGHT)
chunk_174_LEFT,"181
 
Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
x difficulties for hospitals in transferring 
patients for specialist care, especially 
for neurosurgery (stabilisation of patient 
first, co-ordination between the first 
hospital and the specialist hospital and 
consequent long delays).  
Methods 
A modelling of the flow of trauma 
patients was carried out to determine 
the best trauma service configuration for 
adult trauma patients with severe injury 
in the London area. The model was 
designed to estimate the time from injury 
x Critical Intervention (urgent life saving 
interventions such as intubation); these 
interventions are crucial for all trauma 
patients 
x Definitive Intervention (specialist 
interventions such as neurosurgery); these 
interventions vary according to the site 
of the trauma 
The specific aims of the modelling 
exercise were to evaluate the effect on 
time to intervention of: 
(a) different bypass strategies  
(b) improving the current system by 
reducing time taken in pre-hospital and 
in-hospital trauma management. 
(c) a doctor in the pre-hospital phase 
provided by the London Helicopter 
Emergency Medical Service (HEMS). 
The model simulated results based on 
about 10,000 actual severe injuries from 
the London region.  Of these 33% had 
isolated head injury and a further 18% 
had non-isolated head injury.",174,LEFT,205,Page 174 (LEFT)

considered that it was crucial to carry

Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
Model Results 
 
11.13 shows the median time to 
critical/definitive intervention by type of 
injury and by bypass strategy used.  On 
the left side of the table the results are 
based on current timings.  On the right 
hand side the results are based on 
improved timings.  In the case of the 
isolated head injury patient the median 
time to neurosurgery is 4.8 hours 
currently but would fall to 3.4 hours 
when bypassing patients who are less 
than 20 minutes from a specialist centre.  
Table 11.14 shows the proportion of 
patients that receive interventions within 
the target time.  In the case of the 
isolated head injury patient the number 
receiving neurosurgery within 4 hours 
would increase from 23% with no 
bypass to 74% with bypassing patients 
who are less than 20 minutes from a 
specialist centre.  However, on the 
negative side with this bypass strategy 
only 84% (compared with 91%) would 
receive critical intervention within 60 
minutes.  The group that is made worse 
off by bypass is those patients with 
isolated orthopaedic injury: only 25% 
would receive their definitive 
intervention within their 2 hour target 
(compared with 30% without bypass). 
For the injuries that can be treated in 
every hospital the most rapid movement 
to Definitive Intervention was achieved 
by the models without bypass, and with 
improvement in hospital times. 
For injuries requiring specialist 
management the best models for 
providing early Definitive Intervention 
included 20 minutes bypass,",178,LEFT,252,Page 178 (LEFT)
chunk_178_RIGHT,"improvement in hospital times and use of 
the London HEMS. 
Report conclusions 
The bypass protocol proposed is based 
on the 20 minutes of distance from a 
Multi-Specialty Centre, as this time gives 
the best trade-off between longer time 
to Critical Interventions, and shorter time 
to Definitive Intervention. However, the 
best balance between these opposing 
effects had to be struck by clinical 
judgement, as little evidence was 
available.  
The report recommended that within a 
20 minute drive time of an appropriate 
specialist unit, a patient should be driven 
directly to the specialist unit rather than 
to the local hospital, and that a triage 
system for London should be gradually 
introduced, allowing training of prehospital personnel and evaluation of the 
effectiveness of each of the triage 
criteria. For head injury the initial 
criterion could be based on GCS and 
additional criteria could then be added. 
This would avoid the flooding of MultiSpecialty Centres. 
Review 
The report has a number of limitations: 
x The model, especially the target times, 
was based more on expert judgement 
than hard evidence of clinical 
effectiveness. 
x In reality there will be a continuum of 
risk rather than a time cut-off. 
x The model assumes that the specialist 
hospital has a range of different",178,RIGHT,206,Page 178 (RIGHT)

specialist services in addition to 
neurosciences.  
x The trade-off between the need for 
immediate access to critical interventions 
(e.g. intubation) and the need for faster 
access to definitive interventions (e.g. 
surgery) was made on the basis of 
expert judgement rather than health 
outcomes. 
11.6.3 
Staffordshire model 
The link between time and health 
outcomes missed by the London model 
was captured to some extent in the 
Staffordshire model68.  
It evaluated the impact of 10 different 
transport strategies on survival of 
patients with serious or worse HI (AIS 
more than 2). In the model, survival was 
determined by a number of variables 
including: a) head AIS score, b) nonhead AIS score, c) time to surgery, d) 
grade of staff during transfer, e) 
incidence of hypoxia and hypotension, 
g) distance from hospitals. Some of these 
variables are patient-specific (a,b,g), 
some are service-specific (d) and some 
are determined by the transport 
strategy (c,e). The data used in the 
model came from a variety of sources 
including a large trauma database, the 
published literature and expert opinion.  
Monte Carlo simulation (that is 
repeatedly generating new results by 
simultaneously drawing at random from 
the distribution of each model 
parameter) was used to simulate 10,000 
head injury patients and their outcomes 
under each strategy. 
Table 11.15 shows the results for each 
strategy. All direct transport strategies",179,LEFT,236,Page 179 (LEFT)
chunk_179_RIGHT,"had higher expected survival than a 
strategy of sending all patients to the 
nearest emergency department but 
strategies 2-6 were the most effective. 
Among these strategies, strategy 4 
(direct transport of patients with critical 
head injury, AIS=5) required the least 
number of patients being diverted to 
specialist centres. The results were not 
sensitive to the parameters that were 
determined by expert opinion. 
An important limitation that was 
acknowledged by the authors was that 
AIS score is determined after treatment 
and therefore assessment of patients at 
the scene of the injury is less accurate. 
The implication is that the survival gain 
observed in this model is probably 
larger than can be achieved in reality, 
although the pattern should be the same. 
There are different costs associated with 
each strategy and therefore a costeffectiveness analysis is needed to 
assess which of the 10 strategies is the 
most cost-effective. 
In conclusion, the simulation study shows 
that survival of severe head injury 
patients could be substantially improved 
by transporting patients directly from 
the injury scene to a hospital with a 
specialist neurosciences centre. Costeffectiveness of these strategies was 
determined as described in 11.6.4. 
Comparison with the London model 
The Staffordshire model went a step 
further than the London model by 
estimating the impact of different 
strategies on survival (as well as time) in 
order to trade-off the different 
outcomes.",179,RIGHT,225,Page 179 (RIGHT)
chunk_180_LEFT,"187
 
Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
Both models rely on evidence combined 
with expert opinion to estimate the time 
to intervention.  For the Staffordshire 
model, expert opinion is also used to 
estimate the survival rates.  For the 
London model, expert opinion is also 
used to estimate the target times.  Thus 
there must still be uncertainty around the 
results of both studies as they are not 
based on hard evidence.   
Both research teams recommend bypass 
if the specialist hospital is 20 minutes 
from the injury scene.  The Staffordshire 
model estimated substantial survival 
gains from bypass even if the specialist 
hospital is much further away (53 
minutes).  There are no obvious 
contradictions between the two models 
but the authors of the London report 
have been more cautious in 
recommending bypass over longer 
distances.",180,LEFT,142,Page 180 (LEFT)

11.6.4 
Cost-effectiveness model – Direct 
transport 
We conducted a cost-effectiveness 
analysis of transporting patients with 
serious head injury directly from the 
injury scene to a specialist neurosciences 
hospital (NSH). This was compared to 
initially transporting such patients to the 
nearest emergency department and then 
later transferring them to the NSH after 
stabilising the patient.   
The following general principles were 
adhered to: 
x The GDG was consulted during the 
construction and interpretation of the 
models. 
x The sources of data are published 
studies and expert opinion. 
x Model assumptions were reported 
fully and transparently. 
x The results were subject to sensitivity 
analysis and limitations were discussed. 
x We followed the methods of the NICE 
reference case. Therefore costs were 
calculated from a health services 
perspective. Health gain was measured 
in terms of quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) gained. 
11.6.4.1 
General method 
The model is represented by a decision 
tree (Fig.2): once the ambulance crews 
arrive at the accident scene, the patient 
can be transported either to the nearest 
District General Hospital (DGH) or to a",182,LEFT,189,Page 182 (LEFT)
chunk_182_RIGHT,"Neurosciences Hospital (NSH). Severe 
head injury patients initially admitted to 
the DGH will be subsequently referred 
to the NSH. Patients that survive will 
require rehabilitation and frequently 
some kind of long term care. The number 
of survivors is different in the different 
strategies.  
To assess the cost-effectiveness of direct 
transport we need to assess not just 
changes to ambulance and emergency 
department costs associated with each 
strategy but also any changes in 
rehabilitation and long term care costs 
arising from the different strategies. 
These have to be balanced against the 
health gain. 
We could not find evidence of 
effectiveness that perfectly suits this 
question.  We therefore constructed two 
similar models based on different 
empirical studies:  
Model A: We based this model on the 
only study in the clinical literature review 
that reported both mortality and health 
status (Glasgow Outcome Scale, GOS) 
in head injury patients– Poon et al 
1991135. This study compared a cohort 
of patients that had been directly 
transported to NSH to another cohort 
that were transferred from DGH. This 
study allows us to estimate both the 
QALYs gained and the cost savings 
attributable to improved care status in 
patients being directly transported. 
However, there was concern that this 
study was biased, since case-mix was 
not properly controlled for. For this 
reason we developed a more 
conservative model.",182,RIGHT,220,Page 182 (RIGHT)
chunk_183_LEFT,"190
 
Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
Model B, a conservative model, 
calculates only the health gain 
attributable to those patients who 
survive with direct transport but would 
not survive with a secondary transfer 
strategy. The number of these extra 
survivors is estimated using the results of 
a decision model that was explicitly 
answering our question – Stevenson et al 
200168 (see 11.6.3). Model B does not 
take into account health gain for 
patients who survive under both 
strategies but have an improved health 
status with the direct transport strategy.",183,LEFT,100,Page 183 (LEFT)

Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
For each strategy in both models, the expected healthcare costs and the expected QALYs were 
calculated by estimating the costs and QALYs for each GOS state and then multiplying them by 
the proportion of patients that would be in that state as determined by the strategy taken. Health 
state defined by the GOS state was assumed to be fixed over the lifetime.  
The base case models assume that only patients with serious head injury would be transported. A 
concern is the ability of ambulance crews to determine the severity of the head injury at the 
scene. There might be a risk of overestimating the number of severely injured patients and 
therefore of sending too many patients to the NSH, which would mean that cost-effectiveness is 
reduced and would be risky for patients with multiple trauma. For this purpose, we conducted a 
sensitivity analysis on the number of false positives (patients erroneously deemed having a serious 
head injury) that would be transported to the specialist centre without requiring neurosurgical 
care.   
11.6.4.2 
Methods: Effectiveness 
In Model A, the mortality rate together with the outcomes were derived from a study by Poon at 
al 135 in which a group of patients having an extradural haematoma was directly transported to 
the NSH while another group was only secondarily transferred there (Table 11.17). The mortality 
and the outcomes were assessed six months after the injury.

The survival gain in Model B was derived from the results of a simulation model by Stevenson et 
al68, where the target patient population were adults with a serious head injury (AIS of 3 or 
more) – see 11.6.3.  
The model evaluated 10 different strategies of transporting patients directly to the NSH, which 
selected patients by different criteria (relating to level of AIS score, presence of multiple injuries, 
possibility of pre-hospital intubation, out of hours). Directly transporting all serious head injury 
patients to the NSH led to an estimated increase in survival of 4.5% for injury scenes near to the 
NSH and 3.4% for more distant injury scenes. 
Stevenson et al estimated only mortality and not health status. We assumed that health status in 
the additional survivors would be similar to the general population of patients with serious head",185,LEFT,425,Page 185 (LEFT)

injury treated in a NSH. We used 6-month GOS data from the surviving patients in a UK study, 
Patel 2002197 (Table 11.18). The study population had all had a severe head injury (GCS 8 or 
less) and had been treated in a Neurosciences Critical Care Unit.

We estimated the health loss associated 
with false positives. In fact, for these 
patients the longer the journey from the 
accident scene to the hospital, the higher 
is the risk of death from hypotension. In 
the case of a distant NSH (53 minutes, 
as reported in Stevenson’s model), the 
mortality increases by 0.05%, while it 
increases by 0.03% if the NSH is near 
(20 minutes). These figures derived from 
the calculation of the probability of 
death based on clinical estimates (see 
11.6.4.7). 
11.6.4.3 
Methods: Estimating QALYs 
For each health state we estimated 
QALYs (Quality-Adjusted Life Years) by 
multiplying the discounted life 
expectancy by the utility score 
associated with each state. The 
expected QALYs for each strategy are 
then estimated by summing up the 
QALYs for each state weighted by the 
proportion of patients in that state. 
In order to calculate the QALYs we 
combined data on life expectancy with 
data on quality of life. 
Life expectancy  
The life expectancy of patients in a 
vegetative state (VS) was assumed to be 
10 years 198,199. In the case of a 60 
year old patient in a VS, the life 
expectancy would be shorter and was 
assumed to be the same as for a patient 
in the severe disability state (see below).  
To calculate the life expectancy for 
health states other than VS, we applied 
the standardised mortality rate (SMR), 
reported for 2,320 traumatic brain",187,LEFT,249,Page 187 (LEFT)
chunk_187_RIGHT,"injured patients in Shavelle 2001 200, to 
the general population of England and 
Wales, using the Life Tables. According 
to Shavelle, the SMR decreases during 
the first 4 years post-injury but remains 
constant afterwards. In Shavelle 2001 
the SMR was distinguished according to 
three levels of ambulation: a) none, b) 
some, c) stairs, which we matched 
approximately to the levels of disability 
of the GOS (a=SD, b=MD and c=GR).  
Life expectancy was discounted at a 
rate of 3.5% per year, as required by 
NICE. 
For our base case analysis we estimated 
life expectancy for men aged 40 (the 
average age of a patient in the 
Stevenson study). For our sensitivity 
analysis, we also calculated life-years 
for patients aged 20 and 60. 
Quality of life 
The utility scores in Table 11.19 are a 
measure of the quality of life associated 
with each of the health states on a scale 
from 0 (death) to 1 (perfect health). For 
the good recovery (GR) outcome, we 
used the EQ-5D score of 0.83 reported 
for the United Kingdom population 201. 
The other utility scores were taken from 
a decision analysis, Aoki 1998 202. The 
mean utilities for each GOS score were 
elicited from a sample of 140 subjects 
with a clinical background using the 
standard-gamble method. The GOS 
states in this study were expressed as 
the degree of disability due to brain 
damage caused by subarachnoid 
haemorrhage.",187,RIGHT,232,Page 187 (RIGHT)
chunk_188_LEFT,"195
 
Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
The Poon et al study (Model A) did not 
distinguish between patients that were 
severely disabled (SD) and those that 
were moderately disabled (MD). For 
these patients we used the simple 
average of the two SMRs and the simple 
average of the two utilities. 
Another study was found, Tsauo 
1999203, which reported the utility 
scores associated with each GOS score 
obtained from health professionals in the 
UK using the standard gamble method.  
We did not use this study in our base 
case model for the following reasons: 
- scores were presented for a number 
of time points and there seemed to be 
inconsistency between the estimates 
- the figures were skewed towards high 
values (i.e. the utility associated with a 
moderate disability was higher than the 
average EQ5D utility score for the 
general population in the UK201)  
- the value for the vegetative state was 
missing 
- the number of the health professionals 
interviewed for the elicitation of the 
utility scores was not reported.  
Therefore, we used this study only for 
the purpose of sensitivity analysis.",188,LEFT,193,Page 188 (LEFT)

In the sensitivity analysis on the 
assessment at the scene, we assumed 
that the false positives, if they survive 
the longer transport, would have had the 
same expected QALYs as the good 
recovery (GR) patient.    
Calculating QALYs gained 
 
For Model A, the QALYs gained are 
calculated as follows: 
QALYs gained= Q1-Q0 
Qi = ( PiGR x LEGR x UGR) + (PiD x LED x 
UD)  
where  
Qi =the expected QALYs per patient 
(i=1: with bypass, i=0: without bypass) 
PiGR, PiD, = proportion of patients in each 
of the GOS states at 6 months by 
strategy (where D is both mild disability 
and severe disability combined). 
LEGR, LED, = the discounted life 
expectancy of patients by GOS states 
at 6 months  
UGR, UD, = the utility score for each GOS 
state. 
 
 
For Model B, the QALYs gained are 
calculated as follows: 
QALYs gained=Qi-Q0= ESi x ( ( PGR x 
LEGR x UGR) + ( PMD x LEMD x UMD) + ( PSD 
x LESD x USD) + ( PVS x LEvs x Uvs) ) 
where  
Qi =the expected QALYs per patient 
associated with bypass strategy i,  
Q0 = the expected QALYs per patient 
associated with no bypass,  
ESi = extra survivors=the proportion of 
patients surviving under strategy i that 
would not have survived under the no 
bypass strategy 
PGR, PMD, PSD, PVS, = the proportion of 
extra survivors in each of the GOS 
states at 6 months 
LEGR, LEMD, LESD, LEVS, = the discounted 
life expectancy of patients by GOS 
states at 6 months 
UGR, UMD, USD, UVS, = the utility score for 
each GOS state. 
 
11.6.4.4 
Methods: Ambulance and emergency 
department costs 
Emergency department costs in our 
models are the staff costs associated",190,LEFT,300,Page 190 (LEFT)
chunk_190_RIGHT,"with secondary referral. While the cost 
of the primary transport to the DGH or 
to the NSH is similar, an inter-hospital 
transfer would be more costly than 
transport from the injury scene because 
it requires additional staff and tasks. In 
fact, an anaesthetist and a nurse would 
always accompany a patient who 
required urgent transfer, which 
constitutes 90% of the transfers for head 
injury. The GDG experts estimated the 
total cost of the transfer as equal to 
three-hour time of a nurse and an 
anaesthetist, given the time necessary to 
activate a secondary transfer team at 
the DGH, the time spent in stabilising the 
patient, and the actual transfer time. 
Moreover, on arrival at the NSH the 
patient would need other treatment for 
complications due to the transfer. With 
the average cost of a nurse at £19 per 
hour, and the cost of an anaesthetist 
(specialist registrar) of £34 per hour 204; 
the total cost per patient transferred 
was estimated to be £159.  
The cost of patient management at the 
Emergency Department in the two 
hospitals was not expected to be 
different, according to the GDG 
experts’ estimates, since the staff grades 
would not be different.

2006 Pound Sterling. Costs related to 
previous years were inflated using the

small compared with the additional

survivors.  
We calculated the increased transport 
cost associated with false positives, as 
they will be transported to a more 
distant hospital. The cost was obtained 
from the unit cost of an ambulance per 
minute, £6.50 204, multiplied by the 
distance of the accident scene to the 
hospital, which was 20 minutes (near) or 
53 minutes (far) in the simulation study68.

Methods: Rehabilitation and care costs 
We derived the cost of rehabilitation 
from two UK studies: one, Wood 
1999147, applicable to the severely 
disable patients and the other one, 
Nyein 1999205, applicable to the 
moderately disabled patients (Table 
11.20). The length of rehabilitation for 
the severely disabled group was 14 
months, while it was 75 days for the 
moderately disabled group. We 
assumed patients who had a good 
recovery to undergo the same intensity 
of rehabilitation as the moderately 
disabled group, given the fact that the 
good outcome was assessed six months 
post-injury. Patients in a vegetative state 
were assumed not to receive any 
specific rehabilitative therapy. If any 
rehabilitation service was provided to 
them, its cost was assumed to be 
incorporated in to the cost of long term 
care.   
The same two UK studies were used to 
calculate the annual care costs 
(Tab.11.20); in the case of severely",191,LEFT,237,Page 191 (LEFT)
chunk_191_RIGHT,"disabled patients, the long term care 
was the community care support 
required after rehabilitation and it was 
based on the cost of a support worker. 
Similarly, the long term annual cost for 
the moderate disability group was 
calculated from the weekly cost of care 
three months after discharge from the 
rehabilitation. Patients having a good 
recovery were assumed not to incur any 
long term costs. Patients in a vegetative 
state were assumed to have the same 
annual care costs as those who are in the 
severe disability state.    
Care costs were discounted at a rate of 
3.5% per year, as required by NICE.",191,RIGHT,103,Page 191 (RIGHT)

Thus the model takes into account the 
increased costs of rehabilitation and 
care due to people surviving under 
direct transport, who would not survive 
under the current system. It could be that 
costs of neurosurgery and intensive care 
are also increased if patients are now 
making it to the NSH who would have 
died in transit. Since we do not have 
data on the timing of deaths, we have 
not included such costs in the base case. 
However, for a sensitivity analysis we 
added on the cost of 3 days of level 3 
neurosurgical intensive care for each 
additional survivor. The costs of care in 
an ICU were calculated from the NHS 
Reference Costs 2005-2006177 at 
£1,338 per day. 
Calculating incremental cost 
For Model A the incremental cost is 
calculated as follows: 
Incremental cost = CostNSU - CostDGH  
CostNSU = (PNSUGR x (RHGR + LEGR x 
ACCGR))  
+ (PNSUD x (RHD + LED x ACCD)) 
CostDGH = (PDGHGR x (RHGR + (LEGR x 
ACCGR))) 
+( PDGHD x (RHD + (LED x 
ACCD))) 
+ TC 
where 
CostNSU = the expected cost per patient 
associated with direct transport to the 
NSU 
CostDGH = the expected cost per patient 
associated with a secondary referral to 
the NSU from a DGH 
PNSUGR, PNSUD = the proportion of 
survivors in good recovery or 
mild/severe disability at 6 months with 
direct transport to the NSU 
PDGHGR, PDGHD = the proportion of 
survivors in good recovery or 
mild/severe disability at 6 months with a 
secondary referral 
RHGR, RHD = the cost of rehabilitation by 
GOS state at 6 months (where D is both 
mild disability and severe disability 
combined) 
LEGR, LED = the discounted life 
expectancy of patients by GOS state at 
6 months",193,LEFT,304,Page 193 (LEFT)
chunk_193_RIGHT,"ACCGR, ACCD = annual care cost by 
GOS state at 6 months 
TC = cost of transport in secondary 
referral 
 
 
 
For Model B the incremental cost is 
calculated as follows: 
Incremental cost = Cost i - Cost 0  
= ESi x ((PGR x (RHGR + (LEGR x ACCGR))) 
+ (PMD x (RHMD + (LEMD x ACCMD))) 
+( PSD x (RHSD + (LESD x ACCSD))) + (PVS 
x (RHVS + (LEVS x ACCVS)))) 
 – (TC x PDT)  
where 
Costi = the expected cost per patient 
associated with bypass strategy i 
Cost0 = the expected cost per patient 
associated with secondary referral 
ESi = the proportion of patients surviving 
under strategy i that would not have 
survived under the no bypass strategy 
PGR, PMD, PSD, PVS, = the proportion of 
extra survivors in each of the GOS 
states at 6 months 
RHGD, RHMD, RHSD, RHVS = the cost of 
rehabilitation by GOS states at 6 
months 
LEGR, LEMD, LESD, LEVS, = the discounted 
life expectancy of patients by GOS

A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was 
performed to assess the robustness of 
the model results to plausible variations 
in the model parameters.  
This analysis was applied exclusively to 
the strategy of transporting all patients 
to the NSU (strategy 2) compared no 
bypass in the conservative model B.  
Probability distributions were assigned 
to each model parameter, where there 
was some measure of parameter 
variability (11.21).  We then reestimated the main results 5000 times,",193,RIGHT,278,Page 193 (RIGHT)

Results of the cost-effectiveness analysis 
According to Model A there are large 
QALY gains and large cost savings 
associated with direct transport to the 
NSH – direct transport is dominant 
(Table 11.22). With Model B – the 
conservative model - the QALYs gained 
are smaller and costs are not decreased 
overall (Table 11.23 and Table 11.24). 
However, even with this conservative 
model, direct transport is cost-effective 
(below £20,000 per QALY gained). 
We chose the group of patients who 
were 40 years old at the time of injury 
to represent the results (Table 11.22, 
Table 11.23 and Table 11.24). In the 
tables we report the results for the 
groups of patients of 20 and 60 of age 
as well. In these cases, direct transport 
was the dominant strategy in Model A 
and the incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio was still below the threshold of £ 
20,000 per QALY in Model B. 
After running the Model B 5,000 times, 
the probability that directly transporting 
all the patients to the NSU is costeffective (i.e. probability that the costeffectiveness ratio is below £20,000 per 
QALY gained) is 73% when the NSU 
near the incident scene (within 20 
minutes).  In the cases of a patient aged 
20 or 60, the probability falls to 66%.  
For Model B, we performed a sensitivity 
analysis on the length of stay in the ICU: 
assuming that the most costly level 3 of 
care applies to all the outcome grades, 
the analysis shows that the direct 
transport would still be cost-effective as 
long as the increased length of stay",197,LEFT,275,Page 197 (LEFT)
chunk_197_RIGHT,"does not exceed 3 days per additional 
survivor. Furthermore, even if the LOS 
were longer than this, these costs could

Using model B, we conducted a threshold sensitivity analysis to take into account the negative 
effects of overestimating the number of patients to be taken to the NSH.  We define the positive 
predictive value as the proportion of patients transported directly to the NSH who are correctly 
diagnosed with a severe head injury. It is the number of true positives divided by the sum of both 
the true positives and false positives. In the case that the NSH is far from the accident scene (53 
minutes), the strategy of taking all the patients directly to the NSH is cost-effective as long as the 
positive predictive value is more than 28%. If the NSH is near the accident scene (20 minutes), the 
direct transport to the NSH is marginally cost-effective strategy even if the positive predictive 
value is as low as 10%. 
Using model B we performed a sensitivity analysis by using an alternative set of utility scores.  
The result was that direct transport strategy proved to be even more cost-effective than in the 
original model (Table 11.25).

Discussion 
We found that direct transport is potentially cost saving if the health status of patients are 
substantially improved as was indicated by the Poon study. Even in our conservative model we 
find that direct transport is cost-effective. But our analysis is limited for a number of reasons. 
First, some of our assumptions regarding cost and survival were based on proxies or were 
extrapolated in to the long term. 
Our conservative model, Model B, was based on the mortality results of a previous simulation 
model. Some of the parameters in the simulation model were based on expert judgement (those 
listed in Table 11.26). The main clinical outcomes from which the probability of death derives 
were estimated by experts. In particular, experts were asked to estimate the number of patients 
that would have survived assuming they received the appropriate care (critical intervention or 
neurosurgery) at time zero. The actual time elapsed since the accident and its related probability",199,LEFT,413,Page 199 (LEFT)

of death was taken from the database. Having these two points on the probability of death 
graph, a straight line was drawn.  The authors found that the results were not sensitive to the 
slope of the line. However, the curve representing the real relationship between time to 
intervention and probability of death could have a different shape.

Head Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. 
For simplicity, neither model considers 
the change in health status during the 
patient’s lifetime - they assume that the 
GOS score (assessed six months after 
the head injury) remains constant. If 
instead patients continue to improve 
after 6 months then our conservative 
model is underestimating the health gain 
and cost-effectiveness associated with 
direct transport. Likewise, our assumption 
that mortality is increased compared 
with the general population for survivors 
over their entire lifetime is a 
conservative one.  
We have probably underestimated the 
cost savings attributable to direct 
transport because we included only 
hospital personnel (one anaesthetist and 
a nurse), omitting for the costs of drugs, 
equipment and ambulance.  However, 
we have also omitted additional acute 
costs associated with direct transport in 
the treatment of complications such as 
hypoxia and hypotension, which are less 
likely if the patient has been stabilised 
earlier. This would require additional 
treatments such as volume replacement, 
blood transfusion, and in some extreme 
cases they would require surgery or 
ventilatory support for weeks.  
A strategy of direct transport from the 
injury scene to an NSH will inevitably 
mean that the unit sees more patients 
than previously, even though many 
patients currently being taken to the 
nearest emergency department are 
subsequently transferred to the NSH. 
From the viewpoint of the NSH there will 
be a substantial cost impact in particular 
in terms of ITU beds.",201,LEFT,243,Page 201 (LEFT)
chunk_201_RIGHT,"In the long-term, this should not represent 
an increase in cost to the NHS since 
patients and their treatment costs are 
merely being shifted from one hospital 
to another. Furthermore we have no 
reason to believe that ITU costs are 
higher at the NSH; indeed according to 
the 2006 Reference Costs177, the cost of 
a bed in a neurosurgical ITU is lower 
than the cost of a bed in a general ITU. 
Hence we did not include ITU costs in our 
base case analysis. 
In the short-term, the resource impact is 
less clear and will depend on local 
circumstances. A DGH might not achieve 
the full cost savings from seeing fewer 
patients as typically it would be losing 
only ¼ of an ITU bed. However, staff 
costs and consumables would be redeployed almost immediately. The bed 
could also be re-deployed if there is 
currently under-capacity. If so more 
patients would be treated in ITU as a 
result of the increased capacity at DGHs 
but this would not necessarily produce a 
reduction in costs to the Trust.  However, 
this increase in ITU capacity could lead 
to cost savings from reduced transfers. 
To implement a direct transport strategy, 
NSH units will need to invest in extra ITU 
beds. This will be offset by cost savings 
at DGHs. However the cost savings will 
not necessarily offset the cost fully in the 
short-term. The implementation costs 
associated with shifting patients will 
have to be taken in to account in any 
cost impact analysis conducted for the 
purposes of implementation.

by ambulance crews at the incident site, 
after an 8-hour training course. Hence, 
training for ambulance staff in the 
assessment of head injury patients would 
be necessary to safeguard the 
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
the direct transport strategy. 
Since we do not have survival outcomes 
for the other simulation model based in 
London (see 11.6.2) we could not use it 
to estimate cost-effectiveness.  However, 
there is no reason to believe that it 
would effect our conclusions for near 
hospitals: if the specialist hospital is 20 
minutes from the injury scene then direct 
transport is likely to be cost-effective. 
For distances greater than 20 minutes, 
the authors of the London model have 
erred on the side of caution by not 
recommending bypass. It seems logical 
that the further away is the specialist 
hospital the more risky is direct 
transport. Given the uncertainty of the 
evidence in this area, if we are to 
recommend direct transport at all then it 
probably is better to use some kind of 
cut-off but it is unclear how the authors 
of the London model made this decision 
since analyses based on transport times 
longer than 20 minutes are not present 
in the report.   
The London model assumed that not just 
neurosciences but also other specialist 
services were available at the specialist 
centres. If specialist centres contain the 
whole range of services then the issue of 
whether ambulance crews can diagnose 
isolated head injury becomes less of an 
issue (this problem had been raised by 
several stakeholders), as long as 
specialist hospitals have adequate",202,LEFT,274,Page 202 (LEFT)
chunk_202_RIGHT,"provision of beds, etc. Perhaps we 
should be recommending that bypass 
strategies are developed at a regional 
level to take into account local service 
configurations. 
11.6.4.9 Direct transport model: Conclusions 
x A simulation model and some 
empirical studies have shown reduced 
mortality associated with directly 
transporting patients with serious head 
injury to an NSH. 
x If ambulance crews can assess patients 
accurately then a policy of direct 
transport to an NSH is likely to produce 
a net cost saving to emergency 
department services (because of the 
resources involved with stabilising and 
transferring patients).   
x Long term care costs might increase or 
decrease depending on the extent that 
health status (quality of life) is improved 
by direct transport. 
x We found that even with conservative 
estimates about long term care costs, 
direct transport is likely to be costeffective in spite of the very high costs 
of caring for patients with severe 
disability.   
x If ambulance crews (unintentionally) 
overestimate the number of patients to 
be treated in the Neurosciences Centre, 
some patients will experience journeys 
that are longer than necessary and may 
incur complications– in which case health 
gain might be decreased and costs 
increased for these patients.",202,RIGHT,196,Page 202 (RIGHT)
