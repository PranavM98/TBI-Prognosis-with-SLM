The \npurpose of ‘blinding’ or ‘masking’ is to protect against bias. See also Double blind \nstudy, Single blind study, Triple blind study.  \nC-spine \nCervical spine or bony part of the neck \nCase-control study \nA study that starts with the identification of a group of individuals sharing the same \ncharacteristics (for example, people with a particular disease) and a suitable \ncomparison (control) group (for example, people without the disease). All subjects \nare then assessed with respect to things that happened to them in the past, for \nexample, things that might be related to getting the disease under investigation. \nSuch studies are also called retrospective as they look back in time from the outcome \nto the possible causes.  \nCase report (or \ncase study) \nDetailed report on one patient (or case), usually covering the course of that person’s \ndisease and their response to treatment.   \nCase series \nDescription of several cases of a given disease, usually covering the course of the \ndisease and the response to treatment. There is no comparison (control) group of \npatients.  \nCausal \nrelationship \nDescribes the relationship between two variables whenever it can be established \nthat one causes the other. For example there is a causal relationship between a \ntreatment and a disease if it can be shown that the treatment changes the course or \noutcome of the disease. Usually randomised controlled trials are needed to ascertain \ncausality. Proving cause and effect is much more difficult than just showing an \nassociation between two variables. For example, if it happened that everyone who \nhad eaten a particular food became sick, and everyone who avoided that food \nremained well, then the food would clearly be associated with the sickness. \nHowever, even if leftovers were found to be contaminated, it could not be proved \nthat the food caused the sickness – unless all other possible causes (for example, \nenvironmental factors) had been ruled out. \nCerebrospinal \nfluid  \n(CSF) \n \n \nClear fluid which is continuously being produced and absorbed by and in the brain, \nflowing in the ventricles (cavities) within the brain and around the surface of the \nbrain and spinal cord \n \nCSF otorrhea \nEscape of CSF from the brain into the ear canal \nCervical spine \nThe cervical spine is the area of the vertebral column commonly refered to as the \nneck.  \nThe cervical spine is made up of seven vertebrae, refered to by 'C', appended with \nan identifying number. The number indicates the level of the spine in which the \nparticular vertebra is located. The top vertebra is C1, the lowest C7 \n \nCervico-dorsal \njunction \nThe junction between the bottom of the cervical spine and the top of the dorsal (or \nthoracic) spine. \nClinical audit \nA systematic process for setting and monitoring standards of clinical care. Whereas \n‘guidelines’ define what the best clinical practice should be, ‘audit’ investigates \nwhether best practice is being carried out. Clinical audit can be described as a \ncycle or spiral. Within the cycle there are stages that follow a systematic process of \nestablishing best practice, measuring care against specific criteria, taking action to \nimprove care, and monitoring to sustain improvement. The spiral suggests that as the \nprocess continues, each cycle aspires to a higher level of quality.  \nClinical decision \nrule \nA clinical decision rule/clinical prediction rule is generated by initially examining, \nand ultimately combining, a number of variables to predict the likelihood of a \ncurrent diagnosis of a future event. Sometimes, if the likelihood is sufficiently high or \nlow, the rule generates a suggested course of action1. \nClinical \neffectiveness \nThe extent to which a specific treatment or intervention, when used under usual or \neveryday conditions, has a beneficial effect on the course or outcome of disease \ncompared to no treatment or other routine care. (Clinical trials that assess \neffectiveness are sometimes called management trials.) Clinical ‘effectiveness’ is not \nthe same as efficacy. \nClinical impact \nThe effect that a guideline recommendation is likely to have on the treatment, or \ntreatment outcomes, of the target population.",

    "text": "20\n \nHead Injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in infants, children and adults. \nClinical question \nThis term is sometimes used in guideline development work to refer to the questions \nabout treatment and care that are formulated in order to guide the search for \nresearch evidence. When a clinical question is formulated in a precise way, it is \ncalled a focused question. \nClinical trial  \n \nA research study conducted with patients which tests out a drug or other intervention \nto assess its effectiveness and safety. Each trial is designed to answer scientific \nquestions and to find better ways to treat individuals with a specific disease. This \ngeneral term encompasses controlled clinical trials and randomised controlled trials. \nClinician \nA healthcare professional providing patient care, for example, doctor, nurse, \nphysiotherapist.  \nClosed head injury \nA blow to the head or a severe shaking causing  tearing, shearing or stretching of \nthe nerves at the base of the brain, blood clots in or around the brain or oedema \n(swelling) of the brain. There is no penetration of the skull or brain tissue by an \nobject; the skull may be fractured but this does not result in a direct connection \nbetween the brain and the outside. (see Penetrating Brain Injury) \nCluster \nrandomisation \nA study in which groups of individuals (for example, patients in a General \nPractitioner surgery or on a hospital ward) are randomly allocated to treatment \ngroups. Take, for example, a smoking cessation study of two different interventions \n– leaflets and teaching sessions. Each General Practitioner surgery within the study \nwould be randomly allocated to administer one of the two interventions. See also \nCluster, Cluster design. \nCoagulopathy \nA condition affecting the blood's ability to form a clot. \nCochrane \nCollaboration \nAn international organisation in which people find, appraise and review specific \ntypes of studies called randomised controlled trials. The Cochrane Database of \nSystematic Reviews contains regularly updated reviews on a variety of health issues \nand is available electronically as part of the Cochrane Library.  \nCochrane Library \nThe Cochrane Library consists of a regularly updated collection of evidence-based \nmedicine databases including the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews \n(reviews of randomised controlled trials prepared by the Cochrane Collaboration). \nThe Cochrane Library is available on CD-ROM and the Internet. \nCohort \nA group of people sharing some common characteristic (for example, patients with \nthe same disease), followed up in a research study for a specified period of time. \nCohort study \nAn observational study that takes a group (cohort) of patients and follows their \nprogress over time in order to measure outcomes such as disease or mortality rates \nand make comparisons according to the treatments or interventions that patients \nreceived. Thus within the study group, subgroups of patients are identified (from \ninformation collected about patients) and these groups are compared with respect \nto outcome, for example, comparing mortality between one group that received a \nspecific treatment and one group which did not (or between two groups that \nreceived different levels of treatment). Cohorts can be assembled in the present \nand followed into the future (a ‘concurrent’ or ‘prospective’ cohort study) or \nidentified from past records and followed forward from that time up to the present \n(a ‘historical’ or ‘retrospective’ cohort study). Because patients are not randomly \nallocated to subgroups, these subgroups may be quite different in their \ncharacteristics and some adjustment must be made when analysing the results to \nensure that the comparison between groups is as fair as possible.  \nComa \nA sleep-like state in which a person is not conscious.  \nCo-morbidity \nCo-existence of a disease or diseases in the people being studied in addition to the \nhealth problem that is the subject of the study. \nCommunity health \nservices \nGeneral Practice, ambulance crews, NHS walk-in centres and dental practitioners. \nConcussion \nThe common result of a blow to the head or sudden deceleration usually causing an \naltered mental state, either temporary or prolonged. Physiological and/or \nanatomical disruption of connections between some nerve cells in the brain may \noccur. Often used by the public to refer to a brief loss of consciousness. \nConfidence \ninterval \nA way of expressing certainty about the findings from a study or group of studies, \nusing statistical techniques. A confidence interval describes a range of possible \neffects (of a treatment or intervention) that are consistent with the results of a study \nor group of studies. A wide confidence interval indicates a lack of certainty or \nprecision about the true size of the clinical effect and is seen in studies with too few \npatients. Where confidence intervals are narrow they indicate more precise \nestimates of effects and a larger sample of patients studied. It is usual to interpret \na ‘95%’ confidence interval as the range of effects within which we are 95%",

For example, if a group of people \nexercising regularly and a group of people who do not exercise have an important \nage difference then any difference found in outcomes about heart disease could \nwell be due to one group being older than the other rather than due to the \nexercising. Age is the confounding factor here and the effect of exercising on heart \ndisease cannot be assessed without adjusting for age differences in some way.  \nConsciousness \nAn alert cognitive state in which you are aware of yourself and your situation \nConsensus \ndevelopment \nconference \nA technique used for the purpose of reaching an agreement on a particular issue. It \ninvolves bringing together a group of about 10 people who are presented with \nevidence by various interest groups or experts who are not part of the decision \nmaking group. The group then retires to consider the questions in the light of the \nevidence presented and attempts to reach a consensus. See also Consensus methods. \nConsensus \nmethods \nA variety of techniques that aim to reach an agreement on a particular issue. \nFormal consensus methods include Delphi and nominal group techniques, and \nconsensus development conferences. In the development of clinical guidelines, \nconsensus methods may be used where there is a lack of strong research evidence \non a particular topic.  \nConsistency \nThe extent to which the conclusions of a collection of studies used to support a \nguideline recommendation are in agreement with each other. See also Homogeneity.\nControl group \nA group of patients recruited into a study that receives no treatment, a treatment of \nknown effect, or a placebo (dummy treatment) - in order to provide a comparison \nfor a group receiving an experimental treatment, such as a new drug. \nControlled clinical \ntrial (CCT) \nA study testing a specific drug or other treatment involving two (or more) groups of \npatients with the same disease. One (the experimental group) receives the \ntreatment that is being tested, and the other (the comparison or control group) \nreceives an alternative treatment, a placebo (dummy treatment) or no treatment. \nThe two groups are followed up to compare differences in outcomes to see how \neffective the experimental treatment was. A CCT where patients are randomly \nallocated to treatment and comparison groups is called a randomised controlled \ntrial. \nCost benefit \nanalysis \nA type of economic evaluation where both costs and benefits of healthcare \ntreatment are measured in the same monetary units. If benefits exceed costs, the \nevaluation would recommend providing the treatment.  \nCost effectiveness \nA type of economic evaluation that assesses the additional costs and benefits of \ndoing something different. In cost effectiveness analysis, the costs and benefits of \ndifferent treatments are compared. When a new treatment is compared with \ncurrent care, its additional costs divided by its additional benefits is called the cost \neffectiveness ratio. Benefits are measured in natural units, for example, cost per \nadditional heart attack prevented. \nCost utility \nanalysis \nA special form of cost effectiveness analysis where benefit is measured in quality \nadjusted life years. A treatment is assessed in terms of its ability to extend or \nimprove the quality of life. \nCranial \nPertaining to the cranium. \nCraniocervical \njuntion \nThe junction between the base of the skull and the top of the cervical spine. \nCrossover study \ndesign \nA study comparing two or more interventions in which the participants, upon \ncompletion of the course of one treatment, are switched to another. For example, \nfor a comparison of treatments A and B, half the participants are randomly \nallocated to receive them in the order A, B and half to receive them in the order B, \nA. A problem with this study design is that the effects of the first treatment may \ncarry over into the period when the second is given. Therefore a crossover study \nshould include an adequate ‘wash-out’ period, which means allowing sufficient time \nbetween stopping one treatment and starting another so that the first treatment has \ntime to wash out of the patient’s system. \nCross-sectional \nstudy \nThe observation of a defined set of people at a single point in time or time period \n– a snapshot. (This type of study contrasts with a longitudinal study which follows a \nset of people over a period of time.) \nData set \nA list of required information relating to a specific disease. \nDecision analysis \nA systematic way of reaching decisions, based on evidence from research. This \nevidence is translated into probabilities, and then into diagrams or decision trees",

Control Event Rate (CER) and Experimental Event Rate (EER) are the \nterms used in control and experimental groups of patients respectively. \nEvidence based \nclinical practice  \nEvidence based clinical practice involves making decisions about the care of \nindividual patients based on the best research evidence available rather than \nbasing decisions on personal opinions or common practice (which may not always be \nevidence based). Evidence based clinical practice therefore involves integrating \nindividual clinical expertise and patient preferences with the best available \nevidence from research \nEvidence table \nA table summarising the results of a collection of studies which, taken together, \nrepresent the evidence supporting a particular recommendation or series of \nrecommendations in a guideline. \nExclusion criteria \nSee Selection criteria. \nExperimental \nstudy \nA research study designed to test if a treatment or intervention has an effect on the \ncourse or outcome of a condition or disease - where the conditions of testing are to \nsome extent under the control of the investigator.

Such \nresults may occur as a result of differences between studies in terms of the patient \npopulations, outcome measures, definition of variables or duration of follow-up.  \nHierarchy of \nevidence \nAn established hierarchy of study types, based on the degree of certainty that can \nbe attributed to the conclusions that can be drawn from a well conducted study. \nWell-conducted randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are at the top of this hierarchy. \n(Several large statistically significant RCTs which are in agreement represent \nstronger evidence than say one small RCT.) Well-conducted studies of patients’ \nviews and experiences would appear at a lower level in the hierarchy of evidence. \nHomogeneity \nThis means that the results of studies included in a systematic review or meta analysis \nare similar and there is no evidence of heterogeneity.

In \nrecent years odds ratios have become widely used in reports of clinical studies. \nThey provide an estimate (usually with a confidence interval) for the effect of a \ntreatment. Odds are used to convey the idea of ‘risk’ and an odds ratio of 1 \nbetween two treatment groups would imply that the risks of an adverse outcome \nwere the same in each group. For rare events the odds ratio and the relative risk \n(which uses actual risks and not odds) will be very similar.

In other words, the \nchange in health, functional ability, symptoms or situation of a person, which can be \nused to measure the effectiveness of care/ treatment/ rehabilitation.

For example, if study participants know they are in the control group \nthey may be more likely to use other forms of care; people who know they are in \nthe experimental group may experience placebo effects, and care providers may \ntreat patients differently according to what group they are in. Masking (blinding) of \nboth the recipients and providers of care is used to protect against performance \nbias. \nPeriorbital \nhaemotoma \nBleeding around or behind the eyes.  \nPilot study \nA small scale ‘test’ of the research instrument. For example, testing out (piloting) a \nnew questionnaire with people who are similar to the population of the study, in \norder to highlight any problems or areas of concern, which can then be addressed \nbefore the full scale study begins. \nPlacebo \nPlacebos are fake or inactive treatments received by participants allocated to the \ncontrol group in a clinical trial which are indistinguishable from the active treatments \nbeing given in the experimental group. They are used so that participants are \nignorant of their treatment allocation in order to be able to quantify the effect of \nthe experimental treatment over and above any placebo effect due to receiving \ncare or attention.  \nPlacebo effect \nA beneficial (or adverse) effect produced by a placebo and not due to any \nproperty of the placebo itself.  \nPositive predictive \nvalue \nThe proportion of individuals with a positive test result \nwho actually have the disease. \nPower \nSee Statistical power. \nPrimary care \nHealthcare delivered to patients outside hospitals. Primary care covers a range of \nservices provided by General Practitioners, nurses and other healthcare \nprofessionals, dentists, pharmacists and opticians.  \nProbability \nHow likely an event is to occur, for example, how likely a treatment or intervention \nwill alleviate a symptom. \nPrognostic factor \nPatient or disease characteristics, for example, age or co-morbidity, which influence \nthe course of the disease under study. In a randomised trial to compare two \ntreatments, chance imbalances in variables (prognostic factors) that influence patient \noutcome are possible, especially if the size of the study is fairly small.

By convention, \nwhere the value of P is below 0.05 (that is, less than 5%) the result is seen as \nstatistically significant. Where the value of P is 0.001 or less, the result is seen as \nhighly significant. P values just tell us whether an effect can be regarded as \nstatistically significant or not. In no way do they relate to how big the effect might \nbe, for which we need the confidence interval.  \nQualitative \nresearch \nQualitative research is used to explore and understand people’s beliefs, \nexperiences, attitudes, behaviour and interactions. It generates non-numerical data, \nfor example, a patient’s description of their pain rather than a measure of pain. In \nhealthcare, qualitative techniques have been commonly used in research \ndocumenting the experience of chronic illness and in studies about the functioning of \norganisations. Qualitative research techniques such as focus groups and in depth \ninterviews have been used in one-off projects commissioned by guideline \ndevelopment groups to find out more about the views and experiences of patients \nand carers.  \nQuality adjusted \nlife years (QALYS) \nA measure of health outcome. QALYS are calculated by estimating the total lifeyears gained from a treatment and weighting each year with a quality of life \nscore. \nQuantitative \nresearch \nResearch that generates numerical data or data that can be converted into \nnumbers, for example clinical trials or the national Census which counts people and \nhouseholds. \nQuasi \nexperimental \nstudy \nA study designed to test if a treatment or intervention has an effect on the course or \noutcome of disease. It differs from a controlled clinical trial and a randomised \ncontrolled trial in that: \na) the assignment of patients to treatment and comparison groups is not done \nrandomly, or patients are not given equal probabilities of selection, or  b) the \ninvestigator does not have full control over the allocation and/or timing of the \nintervention, but nonetheless conducts the study as if it were an experiment, \nallocating subjects to treatment and comparison groups.  \nRandom allocation \nor Randomisation \nA method that uses the play of chance to assign participants to comparison groups \nin a research study, for example, by using a random numbers table or a computergenerated random sequence. Random allocation implies that each individual (or \neach unit in the case of cluster randomisation) being entered into a study has the \nsame chance of receiving each of the possible interventions.  \nRandomised \ncontrolled trial \nA study to test a specific drug or other treatment in which people are randomly \nassigned to two (or more) groups: one (the experimental group) receiving the \ntreatment that is being tested, and the other (the comparison or control group) \nreceiving an alternative treatment, a placebo (dummy treatment) or no treatment. \nThe two groups are followed up to compare differences in outcomes to see how \neffective the experimental treatment was. (Through randomisation, the groups \nshould be similar in all aspects apart from the treatment they receive during the \nstudy.)  \nRehabilitation \nA programme of clinical and vocational services with the goal of returning patients",

When the ‘risk’ of the event is the same in \nthe two groups the relative risk is 1. In a study comparing two treatments, a relative \nrisk of 2 would indicate that patients receiving one of the treatments had twice the \nrisk of an undesirable outcome than those receiving the other treatment. Relative \nrisk is sometimes used as a synonym for risk ratio .    \nReliability \nReliability refers to a method of measurement that consistently gives the same \nresults. For example someone who has a high score on one occasion tends to have a \nhigh score if measured on another occasion very soon afterwards. With physical \nassessments it is possible for different clinicians to make independent assessments in \nquick succession – and if their assessments tend to agree then the method of \nassessment is said to be reliable. \nRetrospective \nstudy \nA retrospective study deals with the present/ past and does not involve studying \nfuture events. This contrasts with studies that are prospective. \nReview \nSummary of the main points and trends in the research literature  \non a specified topic. A review is considered non-systematic unless an extensive \nliterature search has been carried out to ensure that all aspects of the topic are \ncovered and an objective appraisal made of the quality of the studies. \nRisk ratio \nRatio of the risk of an undesirable event or outcome occurring in a group of patients \nreceiving experimental treatment compared with a comparison (control) group. The \nterm relative risk is sometimes used as a synonym of risk ratio.  \nSample \nA part of the study’s target population from which the subjects of the study will be \nrecruited. If subjects are drawn in an unbiased way from a particular population, \nthe results can be generalised from the sample to the population as a whole.     \nSampling \nRefers to the way participants are selected for inclusion in a study. \nSampling frame \nA list or register of names which is used to recruit participants to a study. \nSecondary care \nCare provided in hospitals. \nSeizure \nAn uncontrolled discharge of nerve impulses which may spread throughout the brain. \nIt usually lasts only a few minutes. It may be associated with loss of consciousness or \nloss of bowel and bladder control. \nSelection bias \nSelection bias has occurred if: \n) \nthe characteristics of the sample differ from those of the wider population from \nwhich the sample has been drawn  OR \n) \nthere are systematic differences between comparison groups of patients in a \nstudy in terms of prognosis or responsiveness to treatment. \nSelection criteria \nExplicit standards used by guideline development groups to decide which studies \nshould be included and excluded from consideration as potential sources of \nevidence. \nSemi-structured \ninterview \nStructured interviews involve asking people pre-set questions. A semi-structured \ninterview allows more flexibility than a structured interview. The interviewer asks a \nnumber of open-ended questions, following up areas of interest in response to the \ninformation given by the respondent. \nSensitivity \nIn diagnostic testing, it refers to the chance of having a positive test result given that \nyou have the disease. 100% sensitivity means that all those with the disease will test \npositive, but this is not the same the other way around. A patient could have a \npositive test result but not have the disease – this is called a ‘false positive’. The \nsensitivity of a test is also related to its ‘negative predictive value’ (true negatives) – \na test with a sensitivity of 100% means that all those who get a negative test result \ndo not have the disease. To fully judge the accuracy of a test, its Specificity must \nalso be considered.  \nSequelae \nPlural of sequela, which is any abnormal condition that occurs subsequent to and/or \nis caused by disease, injury, or treatment. \nSingle blind study \nA study in which either the subject (patient/participant) or the observer \n(clinician/investigator) is not aware of which treatment or intervention the subject is \nreceiving. \nSpecific indication \nWhen a drug or a device has a specific remit to treat a specific condition and is not \nlicensed for use in treating other conditions or diseases.  \nSpecificity \nIn diagnostic testing, it refers to the chance of having a negative test result given \nthat you do not have the disease. 100% specificity means that all those without the \ndisease will test negative, but this is not the same the other way around.

Modifications to this \nguideline have since been published by \nthe Society of British Neurological \nSurgeons in 1998, the Royal College of \nSurgeons of England in 1999 and by the \nScottish Intercollegiate Guidelines \nNetwork in 2000.11-13The assessment \nand imaging of patients who have \nsustained a head injury is also \naddressed by guidelines from the Royal \nCollege of Radiologists.14 \nThe recent recommendations of the \nScottish Intercollegiate Guidelines \nNetwork centre around the identification \nof patients with a high (for example, \nover 10%) risk of intracranial \ncomplications using the GCS, the \npresence of a skull fracture and various \nother clinical variables.

This rule identifies a high-risk \ngroup that has an 89% risk of PCS and \na low risk group with a risk of PCS of \n9%. Unfortunately 50% of patients then \nfall into a medium risk category, where \nthe risk is 47% for PCS. Therefore the \nonly category that may be of use for \nexcluding patients from follow up is the \nlow risk category, but this category was \nderived from only eleven patients.  \nTherefore this study, although being the \nonly paper to attempt the derivation of \na rule is still really only of use to",

However, the number of CT scanners and trained staff in the NHS is limited and the cost of \ntesting substantial. Therefore CT scanning in the NHS is currently restricted mainly to those with \nsignificant loss of consciousness (either on arrival or after deterioration) and those with a skull \nfracture, as diagnosed through skull X-ray. The question arises as to whether CT scanning would \nbe cost-effective (that is, value for money) if extended to a larger group of patients. \n11.3.1 \nLiterature review \nSix studies have evaluated the overall impact of different diagnostic testing strategies for \npatients with minor/mild head injury. The UK studies date back to the early 1980s (pre-CT \nscanning) and advocate that both skull X-ray and in-patient observation be reduced to save \ncosts.178-180 \nThree overseas studies have compared CT scanning with alternative strategies.  Ingebrigtsen and \nRomner 181 found that in-patient observation was not necessary with CT. Therefore CT screening \nwas less costly than skull X-ray screening in Norway because it reduced in-patient stays. \nShackford et al 182 and Stein et al 183 had already come to the same conclusion for the USA.  \nHowever, Stein et al also considered the potential use of X-ray screening without in-patient \nobservation and not surprisingly found this to be the least costly strategy. \nEssentially all three studies have concluded that a system of CT scanning high risk patients \nfollowed by discharge after a negative CT scan is less costly than skull X-ray and admission for \nall of these patients. However, this comparison is not strictly relevant to the context of England \nand Wales because the current system does not admit all patients. \nThe published evidence from the six studies is not ideal because: \nx the resource use and cost for CT scanning is not specific to the UK NHS context or is dated; and",

They found a \ncost of $16,900 per potentially (or definitely) unstable fracture and $50,600 per definitely \nunstable fracture. This is cost-effective given the consequences of paralysis. \nx Blackmore et al 121, using test sensitivities pooled from the published literature, compared CT \nscanning of the cervical spine with conventional cervical spine X-ray. Using their own risk rating \nscale, they found CT scanning to be a cost-effective strategy ($16,000 per quality-adjusted lifeyear gained) for the ‘high’ and ‘moderate’ risk groups (high energy mechanism and age under \n50 or moderate energy mechanism and age greater than 50) but not for the low risk group \n($84,000 per QALY gained).  Unlike the other studies, incorporated into these figures are the \ncosts and morbidity associated with paralysis. \nx In addition, two more studies estimated the costs that could be saved by moving from current \npractice at a particular institution to a particular scanning protocol.122,192 \nThe above studies are not strictly relevant to the context of England and Wales, not least \nbecause the unit costs and the patient groups used in the studies are not from the UK. Furthermore \nthey only attempted to include outcomes 1 and 2 (and in the case of Blackmore et al 4 and 6 as \nwell) and crucially do not address the long term effects of medical radiation, which are likely to \nbe greater in CT scanning of the neck than in CT scanning of the head (see Chapter 10). \nThe Blackmore analysis suggests for a patient group that is at particularly high risk of paralysis, \ncervical spine CT could be preferable to X-ray by both improving health outcomes and lowering \ncosts. However, they do not take into account the impact of the large radiation dose received by \nthe thyroid from a cervical spine CT scan. This would be very difficult to model given the lack of \nempirical evidence on the long term effects of this medical radiation. It was the consensus of the \nGuideline Development Group that the benefits from CT scanning of the cervical spine do not \nobviously outweigh the risks.  \nIn light of the review of new clinical and cost-effectiveness evidence, the GDG modified its \nposition to recommend CT scanning in high risk patients.

If the NSH is near the accident scene (20 minutes), the \ndirect transport to the NSH is marginally cost-effective strategy even if the positive predictive \nvalue is as low as 10%. \nUsing model B we performed a sensitivity analysis by using an alternative set of utility scores.  \nThe result was that direct transport strategy proved to be even more cost-effective than in the \noriginal model (Table 11.25).  \nTable 11.25: Results of the sensitivity analysis on the utility – Model B \n \nIncremental \ncost  \ngained   \nFar NSU –  \nDirect to NSH vs \nFirst to DGH (base \n7,058  \n0.53 \n13,369  \ncase age 40) \nNear NSU –  \nDirect to NSH vs \nFirst to DGH (base \n9,393 \n0.70 \n13,442 \ncase age 40) \n11.6.4.8 \nDiscussion \nWe found that direct transport is potentially cost saving if the health status of patients are \nsubstantially improved as was indicated by the Poon study. Even in our conservative model we \nfind that direct transport is cost-effective. But our analysis is limited for a number of reasons. \nFirst, some of our assumptions regarding cost and survival were based on proxies or were \nextrapolated in to the long term. \nOur conservative model, Model B, was based on the mortality results of a previous simulation \nmodel. Some of the parameters in the simulation model were based on expert judgement (those \nlisted in Table 11.26). The main clinical outcomes from which the probability of death derives \nwere estimated by experts. In particular, experts were asked to estimate the number of patients \nthat would have survived assuming they received the appropriate care (critical intervention or \nneurosurgery) at time zero.
