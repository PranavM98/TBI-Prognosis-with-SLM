Delphi points 1 to 3 refer to recommendations 1 to 3 concerning clinical
question 1, point 4 refers to a recommendation that was dropped due to
irrelevance (see main text), points 5 and 6 refer to recommendations 1 and 2
concerning clinical question 2, point 7 refers to the guideline draft including
the help sheet, point 8 refers to the written discharge advice and point 9 to
the in-hospital monitoring routines.
Ca = consensus against; Cf = consensus in favor; nC = no consensus.

Two members did not reply. Delphi points 1 to 3 refer to recommendations 1
to 3 concerning clinical question 1, point 4 refers to a recommendation that
was finally dropped due to irrelevance (see main text), points 5 and 6 refer to
recommendations 1 and 2 concerning clinical question 2, point 7 refers to the
guideline draft including the help sheet, point 8 refers to the written
discharge advice and point 9 to the in-hospital monitoring routines.

neurological deficits), or GCS 15 with loss of consciousness or repeated (≥2) vomiting and no other risk factors,
be sampled for analysis of S100B if less than 6 h have
elapsed following trauma. If S100B is less than 0.10 μg/l,
the patient may be discharged without a CT (moderate
quality, strong recommendation).
The evidence was initially of high quality but was
downgraded due to study design (mostly selection bias)
and indirectness (outcomes were rarely reported). However, studies consistently show that low S100B levels
can be used to select patients who do not need a CT
scan and, hence, may save valuable resources. Of the
few missed patients in the literature, almost all are nonneurosurgical lesions. Some studies include risk factors
such as GCS 13, anticoagulation and focal neurological
deficits in the inclusion criteria. The working group,
