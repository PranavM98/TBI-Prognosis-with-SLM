designed as evidence and consensus-based guidance for
physicians who are not experts in the field. Physicians
who have considerable experience with these patients
should naturally be allowed to defer from the guidelines
according to clinical judgment.
Conclusions
We present guidelines for initial management of adults
with minimal, mild and moderate head injury based upon
a thorough evidence and consensus-based methodology.
The guidelines are primarily designed to detect complications after head injury needing either neurosurgical or
medical intervention. They can be applied to all adult
patients and include aspects such as CT and admission
selection, repeat CT selection, monitoring routines and
discharge aspects. However, we suggest external validation before they are widely implemented. Furthermore,
areas with poor evidence, such as clinical monitoring
routines for patients following head injury, should be
addressed in future studies.
