Clinical question 1: ‘Which adult patients with minimal,
mild and moderate head injury need a head CT and
which patients may be directly discharged?’
(1) We recommend that adult patients after mild and
moderate head injury with GCS ≤14, loss of consciousness,
repeated (≥2) vomiting, anticoagulant therapy or coagulation disorders, clinical signs of depressed or basal skull
fracture, post-traumatic seizures or focal neurological deficits should have a CT scan (moderate quality, strong
recommendation).
