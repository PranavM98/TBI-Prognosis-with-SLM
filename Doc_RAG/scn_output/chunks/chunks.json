In 2000, the\nScandinavian Neurotrauma Committee (SNC) presented evidence-based guidelines for initial management of these\ninjuries. Since then, considerable new evidence has emerged.\nMethods: General methodology according to the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II\nframework and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system.\nSystematic evidence-based review according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and MetaAnalyses (PRISMA) methodology, based upon relevant clinical questions with respect to patient-important\noutcomes, including Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) and Centre of Evidence Based\nMedicine (CEBM) quality ratings. Based upon the results, GRADE recommendations, guidelines and discharge\ninstructions were drafted. A modified Delphi approach was used for consensus and relevant clinical stakeholders\nwere consulted.\nConclusions: We present the updated SNC guidelines for initial management of minimal, mild and moderate head\ninjury in adults including criteria for computed tomography (CT) scan selection, admission and discharge with\nsuggestions for monitoring routines and discharge advice for patients. The guidelines are designed to primarily\ndetect neurosurgical intervention with traumatic CT findings as a secondary goal. For elements lacking good\nevidence, such as in-hospital monitoring, routines were largely based on consensus. We suggest external validation\nof the guidelines before widespread clinical use is recommended.\nKeywords: computed tomography, GRADE, guidelines, head/brain injury/trauma, management, prediction rule,\nroutines, S100/S100B/S100BB\nBackground\nTraumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the most common\nreasons for emergency department (ED) care [1].

This selective management has\nreceived more attention following reports of increased\ncancer risks from CT scans, estimated at 1 in 5,000 to\n10,000 for a single head CT scan in young adults [12].\nFollowing a normal CT scan after mild head injury,\nconsensus is generally to discharge patients from the hospital [13,14], although subgroups of patients may still be\nat risk of developing delayed intracranial complications\nof varying significance [15,16].\nIn 2000, the Scandinavian Neurotrauma Committee\n(SNC) presented evidence-based guidelines for the initial\nmanagement of minimal, mild and moderate head injuries [5]. Although external and independent validation\nhas shown the guidelines to function favorably [17,18], it\nis likely that new evidence exists which needs to be considered. The SNC has therefore mandated an update of\nthe guidelines. The aim of the present report is to present\nthese updated guidelines for adults, including the methodology and considerations behind the workflow.\nMethods\nThe overall policy was to follow the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II guideline\ndevelopment framework [19], complemented by the\nGrading of Recommendations Assessment, Development\nand Evaluation (GRADE) system [20]. Consensus was that\nthese two aids would result in a transparent and systematic\nmethodology and the best possible workflow from available\nevidence to guideline construction and implementation.\nThe overall workflow process is shown in Figure 1.\nTask force, working group and stakeholders\nThe SNC consists of neurosurgeons and anesthesiologists\nfrom Scandinavia with expertise in neurotrauma. A task\nforce was initiated within the SNC, consisting of three\nauthors with experience within the field (JU, TI, BR), to\npropose evidence-based recommendations and a draft for\nthe updated guidelines. For the consensus stage of development, a working group was formed consisting of SNC\nmembers. Important stakeholders from general surgery,\nemergency medicine and orthopedics were also involved\nin this process. These specialties initially manage the vast\nmajority of head injury patients in Scandinavia. We also\nconsidered including members of the public in the process but unanimously decided against this as we did not\nbelieve it would facilitate optimal guideline development\nin the present scenario.\nScope, purpose and target population\nThe objective of the guidelines created in the present\nwork would be to assist ED physicians with initial (the\nfirst 24 h) management of all adult patients with minimal,\nmild and moderate head injury, specifically to decide\nwhich patients are to receive CT scanning, admission or",

Head\ninjury severity was predefined according to the Head\nInjury Severity Score (HISS [21]) where minimal represents patients with a GCS score of 15 and no risk factors,\nmild is a GCS score of 14 or 15 with risk factors (such as\namnesia or loss of consciousness (LOC)) and moderate is\na GCS score of 9 to 13.\nThe rationale was primarily to identify all patients\nneeding neurosurgical intervention, including medical\nintervention for high intracranial pressure (assigned a\ncritical level with regard to patient-important outcomes).\nThe secondary goals (assigned important, but not critical, with regard to patient-important outcomes) were\nidentification of non-neurosurgical intracranial traumatic complications and also strong consideration of\nresource use with minimization of unnecessary (normal)\nCT scans and/or admission.\nThe task force decided a priori to make an attempt to\nkeep the guidelines applicable to the complete patient\nspectrum within EDs, that is, to ensure that all adult\npatients with minimal, mild and moderate head injury\ncan be managed according to the guidelines.\nCertain assumptions were also made a priori concerning aspects of management that were deemed unnecessary for critical review. The task force all agreed that\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) would not be considered in these guidelines concerning initial management and that in-hospital observation, instead of CT,\nwould be regarded only as a secondary management\noption. The use of plain skull films was addressed and\nrejected in the previous guidelines. Additionally, we\nchose not to consider later aspects of management, such\nas detection and treatment of post-concussion syndrome\n(PCS) and chronic subdural hematomas. We also agreed\nthat all pathological findings on head CT should lead\nto hospital admission. Finally, we would not address\nthe surgical or medical management of intracranial\ncomplications.\nThe task force was unclear concerning the selection of\npatients for CT scanning or discharge, following minimal,\nmild and moderate head injuries. We were also unclear\nconcerning which patients, irrespective of initial CT scan\nresults, should have hospital admission for clinical observation, a repeat CT scan, or both. Therefore, consensus\nwas achieved to address two important clinical questions\nthat would require systematic review of evidence and\nwould form the basis of the updated guidelines, shown\nbelow.\nClinical question 1: ‘Which adult patients with minimal, mild and moderate head injury need a head CT\nand which patients may be directly discharged?’.\nClinical question 2: ‘Which adult patients with minimal, mild and moderate head injury need in-hospital\nobservation and/or a repeat head CT?’.",

Titles that were obviously not relevant were excluded. Abstracts were examined independently by two authors (JU, BR) and the third (TI) was\nconsulted when discrepancies arose. Selected full papers\nwere independently reviewed by all authors (JU, TI, BR)\nand discrepancies were resolved through discussion.\nReview articles, letters, expert opinion and editorials\ncould be retrieved for examination of bibliographies but\nwere excluded from the analysis. Papers reporting only\nchildren (<18 years) were excluded in both searches. In\ncases where essential data was missing or unclear, we\nmade an attempt to contact corresponding authors for\nclarification. Studies including patients with all severities\nof head injury were only included if at least 50% of\npatients were within the GCS 9 to 15 range.\nFor the first clinical question, we included studies\nreporting patients with admission/initial GCS scores ≥9\nand that included one or more predictive risk factors for\nthe reference standards of CT findings, intracranial\ninjury (ICI) and/or neurosurgical intervention. We\ndecided a priori to only include studies where information concerning true positives (TP), false positives (FP),\ntrue negatives (TN) and false negatives (FN) could be\nextracted. This information would be necessary to fully\nappreciate the possible clinical effect and role of a risk\nfactor, allowing consideration of other effects than the\npositive predictive power. Studies reporting less than 50\npatients were excluded. Definitions for risk factors were\ndefined a priori.\nFor the second clinical question, we included studies\nreporting patients with admission/initial GCS scores ≥9\nwith an initial CT scan (normal or abnormal) and contained information regarding clinical characteristics that\nwere associated with a positive or worsening repeat CT\nscan, ICI and/or neurosurgical intervention within 1\nweek following trauma.\nCT findings were defined as any traumatic finding on\nhead CT. ICI was defined as any intracranial (isolated\nnon-depressed cranial fractures not included) traumatic\nfinding on CT. Also, since not all patients can be subjected to CT, absence of ICI was defined as relevant and\nrobust clinical follow-up suggestive of normal neurological functioning (with the exception of classical PCS\nsymptoms). The decision to consider any CT findings\nand ICI as separate reference standards was due to the\ndifference in clinical importance of these measures. This\napproach should also stratify reference standards in a",

Finally, neurosurgical intervention was\ndefined as any neurosurgical procedure for a cranial or\nintracranial injury within the first week following\ntrauma. Medical treatment for elevated intracranial pressure, within the first week following trauma, was also\nincluded in this group since some patients with diffuse\nbrain injury cannot be managed surgically.\nData extraction and quality assessment\nData was extracted by one author (JU) and checked by\nanother (BR). Data was entered into a predefined protocol\nand then inputted into Excel (Microsoft; Redmond, WA,\nUSA). Evidentiary tables were constructed to summaries\nthe studies. We decided to address the quality of papers in\ndifferent phases, due to the nature of the studies and the\nphase of assessment. Firstly, all retrieved studies were\nindependently graded by all authors in the task force (JU,\nTI, BR) according to the Centre of Evidence Based Medicine (CEBM) diagnosis criteria [23]. Discrepancies in grading were resolved through discussion. Quality ratings\nranged from 1 (strongest evidence, for instance reports of\nclinical decision rules and high quality validation studies)\nto 5 (weakest evidence, often expert opinion). Studies\nreceiving CEBM scores of 5 were excluded.\nStudies were then graded according to the Quality\nAssessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS)\ntool [24], which was modified for the purpose of the\nreview. This tool considers 14 criteria relevant to diagnostic studies accounting for bias (items 3 to 7, 10 to 12),\nvariability (items 1 and 2) and reporting (items 8 and 9).\nItems 4 (regarding the time period between index and\nreference test) and 7 (regarding the independency of the\nreference test) were omitted with regard to the selection\ncriteria and the previously applied CEBM criteria. Additionally, item 3 (regarding the ability of the reference test\nto correctly classify the target condition) was applied to\nCT findings, ICI and neurosurgery separately.\nData analysis\nAlthough extracted data regarding the first clinical question, predictors of CT findings, ICI and neurosurgery,\ncould theoretically be summarized in a meta-analysis, the\ntask force decided a priori not to perform such an analysis\nfor the purpose of development of the guidelines, independent of heterogeneity between studies. We felt combining\nthe data in this way could mislead the working group in\nthe consensus process and opted to instead present\nuncombined data for studies including their quality assessment. We therefore calculated individual positive likelihood ratios (PLR) and negative likelihood ratios (NLR) for\neach risk factor with respect to the corresponding reference test (CT, ICI or neurosurgery) and the prevalence\nof both the reference test and the risk factor in the",

We felt that these indices would represent the\nmost relevant clinical applications for the working group\nwhen considering the recommendations. For the second\nclinical question, we presented only descriptive analysis.\nEvidence summary and recommendations draft\nRecommendations were formed by the task force (JU, TI,\nBR) based upon the evidence in accordance with the\nGRADE system [20,25]. This system is increasingly been\nused in the development of recommendations and allows\nconsideration of aspects other than level of evidence in\ndetermining the strength of a recommendation [25].\nClinical predictors were chosen based upon the summarized evidence (see Additional file 1, Table S1). Focus was\nput on the more severe outcome variables (need for neurosurgery being of critical importance), but ICI and any\nCT findings were also considered, especially in cases\nwhere the evidence concerning neurosurgery was poor\nand/or inconsistent. We also considered the prevalence\nof the risk factors in the studied cohorts. Risk factors\nrelatively common in a population would lead to many\nCT scans and these risk factors would therefore need to\nshow high predictive abilities to be included.\nThe summarized quality of evidence, from studies\nforming the basis of a recommendation, was graded from\nhigh quality to very low quality, see Table 1. Evidence\nwas initially considered high quality when derived from\ncohort studies reporting patients with diagnostic uncertainty and appropriate reference standards, as described\nearlier. Evidence could be downgraded due to risk of bias\n(selection (population indirectness), verification, observer\nand reporting), outcome indirectness (balance between\nthe presumed influence on patient outcome of the test\nresult (combination of risk factors) in relation to the\ncomplications and resource use of the test), inconsistency\n(large differences in prevalence of reference tests, prevalence of risk factors, PLR or NLR) or differing general\nresults between studies), impreciseness (studies with\nsmall number of patients and few positive CT, ICI or\nneurosurgery events) and suspicion of publication bias\n(small number of studies, industry funding).\nRecommendations, relating to the clinical questions,\nwere classed as strong (we recommend...), weak (we\nsuggest...) or uncertain (we cannot recommend...) (see\nTable 1). For this process, careful consideration was again\nmade to risk/benefit aspects of patient-important outcomes\n(need for neurosurgery was classed as the most important)\nin relation to test results, including assumptions for pretest\nprobabilities (different magnitudes of risk for a positive\nreference result of CT, ICI or neurosurgery) for different\npatients, quality of evidence, uncertainty of the preferences\nand values for outcomes and the use of health care\nresources. Therefore, it is theoretically possible to achieve a",

Following\nthis, a modified Delphi process was used [26], involving\nthe working group previously described, consisting of at\nleast two rounds of consensus. The a priori criteria to\ndetermine acceptance, rejection or lack of consensus are\nshown in Table 2. In the first round, the recommendations, including data from included studies with CEBM,\nQUADAS and GRADE evaluations together with a guideline draft were sent via email to the working group.\nRatings, including feedback, were anonymously collected.\nThe task force adjusted the recommendations and draft\nbased upon these responses. Then, in conjunction with a\n2-day SNC meeting in September 2012 outside Copenhagen, Denmark, results were discussed and suggestions for\nimprovements made. Following this, the second round of\nDelhi was completed via email. Additional rounds would\nbe undertaken if necessary. The task force and working\ngroup were urged to consider the GRADE aspects previously mentioned, especially health risk/benefit aspects\nincluding resource use, as well as side effects and risks\n(misclassification of patients), at all stages of development.\nThe final guidelines were evaluated, independently of\nthe task force and working group, in the ED of Skane\nUniversity Hospital, Malmo, Sweden, to judge clarity of\npresentation and ease of use. Simultaneously, the guidelines were evaluated by important stakeholders from\nspecialties directly involved in the everyday management\nof these patients. Feedback was documented and appropriate changes were made, if necessary, but only to consensus aspects. Finally, the working group reapproved\nthe guidelines after presentation of changes and feedback from the evaluation.\nImplementation, monitoring and future updates\nGuidelines will only be successful if they are used correctly\nand on a wide scale. Previous experience with the 2000\nScandinavian guidelines has shown poor compliance and\nvarying degrees of implementation success [27,28]. Implementation and monitoring strategies were discussed within\nthe working group in order to facilitate long-term successful\nuse of the guidelines in Scandinavia. Focus was put on overcoming barriers to application and effectively using available\nresources. The working group also outlined a procedure\nand approximate time period for updating the guidelines.\nResults\nThe search and selection process is shown in Figures 2\nand 3 for the two clinical questions.",

A strong recommendation was chosen\nin spite of weak evidence due to the seriousness of the\ncondition. Clinical aspects such as anticoagulation and\npersistent neurological findings were discussed but the\nworking group could not reach consensus on a recommendation for follow-up scans in these patients.\nGuidelines\nBased upon the recommendations, guidelines were constructed. The addition of shunt-treated hydrocephalus\nwas based upon consensus in the working group with\nlittle evidence to support this. The working group discussed risk factors relating to trauma mechanism and\nmultitrauma injuries but found these difficult to recommend, mainly due to practical issues with clinical application. We considered serious extracranial injuries\n(defined as Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS) >3 to any\norgan system, for instance large (for example, femur)\nfractures or serious thoracic or abdominal injuries) as a\nrisk factor due to the probability of a higher magnitude\nof trauma, need for extracranial CT and the poorer\nprognosis of brain injury in these patients. However, we\nfinally decided to omit this as a risk factor primarily due\nto the difficulty of classifying this risk factor in a busy\nclinical scenario. Additionally, predictive ability was generally only moderate for these risk factors. Also, loss of\nconsciousness was expanded to suspected/confirmed\nloss of consciousness, as it is often difficult to confirm\nthis finding in the clinical setting. Patients who could\nnot clearly deny any loss of consciousness should be\nclassed as suspected. Finally, the working group could\nnot recommend older age or antiplatelet medication as\nindividual risk factors due to the unacceptable CT\nincrease such a recommendation would cause, in combination with only moderate predictive abilities. However,\nconsensus was reached to combine these into one risk\nfactor, namely age ≥65 years and antiplatelet medication.\nWritten instructions for patients being discharged were\nadapted from the 2000 guidelines with consideration of\nthe National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE)\ninstructions [29] and a proposal for evidence-based\ninstructions from Fung et al. [30], (see Additional file 6,\nFigure S1). With the Scandinavian setting in mind, the\ndischarge sheet was heavily simplified for clarity. Observation and monitoring routines for admitted patients\nwere based on consensus in the working group. We discussed the intensity of monitoring routines in relation to\nthe severity of the complications and burden on hospital\nwards and finally decided that these should be relatively\nfrequent shortly after trauma (the first 4 h) with de-escalation over time. Reasonably, most admitted patients will\narrive to a ward after at least 4 h and hence already have\npassed the 15-minute interval period.

All stakeholders and the\nworking group approved the final version, see Additional\nfile 7, Figure S2.\nImplementation, monitoring and future updates\nThe working group decided on implementation by SNC\nmembers in their respective countries. This would be\nperformed through a combination of written and oral\npresentations in national medical journals and national\nmeetings, respectively. We discussed barriers to implementation and decided that the most important of these\nwas probably the absence of sufficient education concerning head injury management in Scandinavia. We\nwould attempt to further facilitate implementation by\nprinting flyers and placards with the guidelines and to\nsend these to Scandinavian hospitals. We would also\ninitiate national training initiatives within the respective\nScandinavian countries.\nWith respect to monitoring aspects, the working group\ndecided to plan a questionnaire to Scandinavian physicians treating head injury to determine the present use of\nguidelines, similar to previous efforts [31]. At 1 year following implementation, a follow-up questionnaire will be\nsent out to establish changes in management routines.\nWe will also initiate studies examining compliance with\nthe guidelines, as previously established in Norway\n[27,28], and attempt to improve insufficient use of the\nguidelines depending on these results. Finally, we will\ninitiate a prospective validation study, also comparing the\nperformance of our guidelines with other guidelines,\ndecision rules and, importantly, unstructured physician\njudgment [32].\nThe working group decided that an update of the\nguidelines would be necessary in 2015. This would\ninclude evidence updates concerning the clinical questions addressed in the present update and would further\nexamine the observation and monitoring routines for\nadmitted patients.\nDiscussion\nSince 2000, considerable evidence has emerged concerning the initial management, particularly risk factors for\nCT selection, of minimal, mild and moderate head injury.\nThe work presented here is, in contrast to our previous\nguidelines, confined to adults but a similar effort regarding management of children is underway.

BMC Medicine 2013, 11:50\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/11/50\npatients needing neurosurgical or medical intervention,\nwith traumatic CT findings being the secondary identification goal.\nIn summary, the evidence was of reasonable quality\nreferring to the predictive ability of risk factors for complications following head injury in these patients. Unsurprisingly, many of the risk factors included here are also\nfound in other guidelines and decision rules [6,9-11,29,33].\nHowever, several differences can be noted. We found that\nthe predictive power of amnesia was too low to be\nincluded. This risk factor was present in the SNC guidelines from 2000, mostly due to the difficultly in ruling out\nloss of consciousness in some patients. For this reason, we\ninclude suspected loss of consciousness as a risk factor.\nRisk factors such as intoxication, trauma above the clavicles, nausea, vertigo and headache were not included\ndue to poor predictive ability combined with a high prevalence of these factors in the head injury population.\nThe working group found injury mechanisms complicated to use practically in initial management and\ndecided not to include these as risk factors.\nOlder age, most often defined as ≥60 or ≥65 years, is\noften included in other guidelines. The predictive ability of\nthis risk factor was only moderate and there was considerable uncertainty in the group with regard to patient\nimportant outcomes and resource use. The number of\npeople in older age groups in industrialized countries is\nincreasing [34] and the increased CT rate that would be\nassociated with this risk factor was deemed unacceptable.\nAlso, the risk factor is common in the head injury cohorts,\nwith between 10% and 45% of patients being over 65 years\nof age in reported cohorts of mild [10,35-38] and moderate [39] TBI. Fabbri et al. recently presented results considering the combination of older age and antiplatelet\nagents [40]. Despite the lack of good evidence for this\ncombination, consensus was reached to include age ≥65\nyears in combination with any antiplatelet agent as a risk\nfactor. It is reasonable to expect that the combination\nwould be more predictive of complications after head\ninjury and result in a smaller CT rate increase when compared to the risk factors used individually. Additionally, it\nhas been suggested that antiplatelet medication may be at\nleast partly responsible for the higher risks for intracranial\ncomplications seen after head injury in older patients [40].\nShunt-treated hydrocephalus was added purely based\non consensus, with evidence derived from expert opinion\nin the group. We acknowledge the poor evidence-based\nbackground to this decision but this patient group is\nuncommon and will not lead to a noticeable increase in\nCT scanning.\nEvidence concerning repeat CT was reasonable but lacking concerning both written discharge advice and observation routines. These aspects were therefore based heavily\nupon consensus with special weight put on adaptation to",

Since in-hospital\nobservation consumes valuable resources, there is a need\nfor stronger evidence examining the need and magnitude\nof these routines.\nFor the first time, a brain biomarker has been introduced into clinical practice guidelines. Using a low cutoff of 0.10 μg/l, the biomarker has shown considerable\nability to predict the absence of CT pathology and neurosurgical intervention [36,41,42]. This negative prediction\nis welcomed since all other risk factors are of positive\npredictive nature. S100B allows for a safe reduction in\nCT scans in a subpopulation of patients with mild head\ninjury. In order to maintain the theoretical safety and\ncost-saving ability, the biomarker should primarily not\nexhibit false negative results. Also, the biomarker should\nonly be taken in patients that would usually receive a CT\nscan and the fraction of negative S100B results (below\ncut-off) should be as large as possible. S100B is clinically\nunspecific [43,44] and has a short half-life [45]. Therefore, patients with extracranial injuries and those seeking\ncare more than 6 h after trauma are not good candidates\nfor S100B sampling due to a risk of false positives and\nnegatives, respectively. Some patients have risk factors\nwith higher predictive abilities and also factors that\nwould usually warrant admission irrespective of CT findings. This group is therefore also not suitable for S100B\nsampling. Despite the relatively good evidence for S100B\nin this setting, biomarkers have historically had different\neffects in actual management and the clinical impact and\nhealth economic implications may alter future recommendations. Based upon the current evidence and clinical\nsetting, however, this biomarker should safely reduce\nresource use if used correctly since low levels are very\nuncommon in patients needing neurosurgical intervention in this setting.\nThere are limitations to the process outlined in this\npaper. Although the recommendations are based upon\nevidence, there were elements of consensus input to the\nfinal guidelines. This is inevitable when dealing with\nthese injuries and we attempted to minimize the negative\neffects of this through our stringent and extensive methodology using the best available tools. Particularly, the\nGRADE system [20] allows consideration of other important aspects other than the level of evidence in recommendations. The derivation and validation of predictive\nrisk factors as performed by other authors [6,10,18]\nwould hardly be feasible in Scandinavia and would only\naccount for one aspect of the management guidelines.\nOur methodology was judged as the most feasible considering the target population. However, external clinical\nvalidation of our guidelines is welcomed and would naturally support successful implementation.\nFinally, these guidelines are, by definition, guidelines\nand should be utilized accordingly.
