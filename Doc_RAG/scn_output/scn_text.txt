In 2000, theScandinavian Neurotrauma Committee (SNC) presented evidence-based guidelines for initial management of theseinjuries. Since then, considerable new evidence has emerged.Methods: General methodology according to the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) IIframework and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system.Systematic evidence-based review according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and MetaAnalyses (PRISMA) methodology, based upon relevant clinical questions with respect to patient-importantoutcomes, including Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) and Centre of Evidence BasedMedicine (CEBM) quality ratings. Based upon the results, GRADE recommendations, guidelines and dischargeinstructions were drafted. A modified Delphi approach was used for consensus and relevant clinical stakeholderswere consulted.Conclusions: We present the updated SNC guidelines for initial management of minimal, mild and moderate headinjury in adults including criteria for computed tomography (CT) scan selection, admission and discharge withsuggestions for monitoring routines and discharge advice for patients. The guidelines are designed to primarilydetect neurosurgical intervention with traumatic CT findings as a secondary goal. For elements lacking goodevidence, such as in-hospital monitoring, routines were largely based on consensus. We suggest external validationof the guidelines before widespread clinical use is recommended.Keywords: computed tomography, GRADE, guidelines, head/brain injury/trauma, management, prediction rule,routines, S100/S100B/S100BBBackgroundTraumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the most commonreasons for emergency department (ED) care [1]. Casesof TBI account for over 1 million visits per year in boththe USA and the UK [2,3] and are responsible for twothirds of all trauma deaths [4]. Only a small proportionof these are classed as severe head injury [1], with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 3 to 8. The majority ofpatients are instead classed as minimal, mild and* Correspondence: dr.johan.unden@gmail.com1Department of Intensive Care and Perioperative Medicine, Institute forClinical Sciences, Södra Förstadsgatan 101, 20502 Malmö, SwedenFull list of author information is available at the end of the article© 2013 Undén et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Aminority of these patients will have intracranial pathologyon computed tomography (CT) scanning and an evensmaller proportion will need neurosurgical intervention[6,7]. In particular, the intermediate risk group of mildhead injury (MHI) has been notoriously difficult to manage as these patients have a very low, but not negligible,risk of needing neurosurgical intervention [7,8].Over the past decade, initial management strategies havebecome focused on selective CT use based upon presenceor absence of specific aspects of patient history and/orclinical examination [6,9-11], in order to effectively use--- Page 3 (LEFT) ---Undén et al. BMC Medicine 2013, 11:50http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/11/50health care resources. This selective management hasreceived more attention following reports of increasedcancer risks from CT scans, estimated at 1 in 5,000 to10,000 for a single head CT scan in young adults [12].Following a normal CT scan after mild head injury,consensus is generally to discharge patients from the hospital [13,14], although subgroups of patients may still beat risk of developing delayed intracranial complicationsof varying significance [15,16].In 2000, the Scandinavian Neurotrauma Committee(SNC) presented evidence-based guidelines for the initialmanagement of minimal, mild and moderate head injuries [5]. Although external and independent validationhas shown the guidelines to function favorably [17,18], itis likely that new evidence exists which needs to be considered. The SNC has therefore mandated an update ofthe guidelines. The aim of the present report is to presentthese updated guidelines for adults, including the methodology and considerations behind the workflow.MethodsThe overall policy was to follow the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II guidelinedevelopment framework [19], complemented by theGrading of Recommendations Assessment, Developmentand Evaluation (GRADE) system [20]. Consensus was thatthese two aids would result in a transparent and systematicmethodology and the best possible workflow from availableevidence to guideline construction and implementation.The overall workflow process is shown in Figure 1.Task force, working group and stakeholdersThe SNC consists of neurosurgeons and anesthesiologistsfrom Scandinavia with expertise in neurotrauma. A taskforce was initiated within the SNC, consisting of threeauthors with experience within the field (JU, TI, BR), topropose evidence-based recommendations and a draft forthe updated guidelines. For the consensus stage of development, a working group was formed consisting of SNCmembers. Important stakeholders from general surgery,emergency medicine and orthopedics were also involvedin this process. These specialties initially manage the vastmajority of head injury patients in Scandinavia. We alsoconsidered including members of the public in the process but unanimously decided against this as we did notbelieve it would facilitate optimal guideline developmentin the present scenario.Scope, purpose and target populationThe objective of the guidelines created in the presentwork would be to assist ED physicians with initial (thefirst 24 h) management of all adult patients with minimal,mild and moderate head injury, specifically to decidewhich patients are to receive CT scanning, admission or--- Page 3 (RIGHT) ---Page 2 of 13discharge (or combinations of these) from the ED. Headinjury severity was predefined according to the HeadInjury Severity Score (HISS [21]) where minimal represents patients with a GCS score of 15 and no risk factors,mild is a GCS score of 14 or 15 with risk factors (such asamnesia or loss of consciousness (LOC)) and moderate isa GCS score of 9 to 13.The rationale was primarily to identify all patientsneeding neurosurgical intervention, including medicalintervention for high intracranial pressure (assigned acritical level with regard to patient-important outcomes).The secondary goals (assigned important, but not critical, with regard to patient-important outcomes) wereidentification of non-neurosurgical intracranial traumatic complications and also strong consideration ofresource use with minimization of unnecessary (normal)CT scans and/or admission.The task force decided a priori to make an attempt tokeep the guidelines applicable to the complete patientspectrum within EDs, that is, to ensure that all adultpatients with minimal, mild and moderate head injurycan be managed according to the guidelines.Certain assumptions were also made a priori concerning aspects of management that were deemed unnecessary for critical review. The task force all agreed thatmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) would not be considered in these guidelines concerning initial management and that in-hospital observation, instead of CT,would be regarded only as a secondary managementoption. The use of plain skull films was addressed andrejected in the previous guidelines. Additionally, wechose not to consider later aspects of management, suchas detection and treatment of post-concussion syndrome(PCS) and chronic subdural hematomas. We also agreedthat all pathological findings on head CT should leadto hospital admission. Finally, we would not addressthe surgical or medical management of intracranialcomplications.The task force was unclear concerning the selection ofpatients for CT scanning or discharge, following minimal,mild and moderate head injuries. We were also unclearconcerning which patients, irrespective of initial CT scanresults, should have hospital admission for clinical observation, a repeat CT scan, or both. Therefore, consensuswas achieved to address two important clinical questionsthat would require systematic review of evidence andwould form the basis of the updated guidelines, shownbelow.Clinical question 1: ‘Which adult patients with minimal, mild and moderate head injury need a head CTand which patients may be directly discharged?’.Clinical question 2: ‘Which adult patients with minimal, mild and moderate head injury need in-hospitalobservation and/or a repeat head CT?’.--- Page 4 (LEFT) ---Undén et al.

MeSH terms were pretestedfor validity through identification of several key articles.It was deemed unlikely that studies prior to 1985 wouldbe useful considering the wide-scale introduction of CT--- Page 4 (RIGHT) ---Page 3 of 13scanning around this period. We did not apply any otherlimitations to the search.For the first clinical question, the MeSH terms and keywords were; ((head trauma) OR (brain injury) OR (headinjury) OR (traumatic head injury) OR (traumatic braininjury)) AND (minimal OR mild OR minor OR moderate) AND (management OR predictors OR predictor).For the second clinical question we used; ((head trauma)OR (brain injury) OR (head injury) OR (traumatic headinjury) OR (traumatic brain injury)) AND (minimal ORmild OR minor OR moderate) AND (hospitalization ORhospitalisation OR observation OR admission OR discharge OR delayed OR ((normal OR negative OR repeat--- Page 5 (LEFT) ---Undén et al. BMC Medicine 2013, 11:50http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/11/50OR multiple OR serial OR follow-up) AND (CT OR CCTOR computed tomography)).Additional papers were identified by hand-searchingbibliographies of retrieved studies.Selection criteria and study eligibilityTitles were examined by one author (JU) and borderlinetitles were included. Titles that were obviously not relevant were excluded. Abstracts were examined independently by two authors (JU, BR) and the third (TI) wasconsulted when discrepancies arose. Selected full paperswere independently reviewed by all authors (JU, TI, BR)and discrepancies were resolved through discussion.Review articles, letters, expert opinion and editorialscould be retrieved for examination of bibliographies butwere excluded from the analysis. Papers reporting onlychildren (<18 years) were excluded in both searches. Incases where essential data was missing or unclear, wemade an attempt to contact corresponding authors forclarification. Studies including patients with all severitiesof head injury were only included if at least 50% ofpatients were within the GCS 9 to 15 range.For the first clinical question, we included studiesreporting patients with admission/initial GCS scores ≥9and that included one or more predictive risk factors forthe reference standards of CT findings, intracranialinjury (ICI) and/or neurosurgical intervention. Wedecided a priori to only include studies where information concerning true positives (TP), false positives (FP),true negatives (TN) and false negatives (FN) could beextracted. This information would be necessary to fullyappreciate the possible clinical effect and role of a riskfactor, allowing consideration of other effects than thepositive predictive power. Studies reporting less than 50patients were excluded. Definitions for risk factors weredefined a priori.For the second clinical question, we included studiesreporting patients with admission/initial GCS scores ≥9with an initial CT scan (normal or abnormal) and contained information regarding clinical characteristics thatwere associated with a positive or worsening repeat CTscan, ICI and/or neurosurgical intervention within 1week following trauma.CT findings were defined as any traumatic finding onhead CT. ICI was defined as any intracranial (isolatednon-depressed cranial fractures not included) traumaticfinding on CT. Also, since not all patients can be subjected to CT, absence of ICI was defined as relevant androbust clinical follow-up suggestive of normal neurological functioning (with the exception of classical PCSsymptoms). The decision to consider any CT findingsand ICI as separate reference standards was due to thedifference in clinical importance of these measures. Thisapproach should also stratify reference standards in a--- Page 5 (RIGHT) ---Page 4 of 13more homogenous selection compared to a combineddefinition. Finally, neurosurgical intervention wasdefined as any neurosurgical procedure for a cranial orintracranial injury within the first week followingtrauma. Medical treatment for elevated intracranial pressure, within the first week following trauma, was alsoincluded in this group since some patients with diffusebrain injury cannot be managed surgically.Data extraction and quality assessmentData was extracted by one author (JU) and checked byanother (BR). Data was entered into a predefined protocoland then inputted into Excel (Microsoft; Redmond, WA,USA). Evidentiary tables were constructed to summariesthe studies. We decided to address the quality of papers indifferent phases, due to the nature of the studies and thephase of assessment. Firstly, all retrieved studies wereindependently graded by all authors in the task force (JU,TI, BR) according to the Centre of Evidence Based Medicine (CEBM) diagnosis criteria [23]. Discrepancies in grading were resolved through discussion. Quality ratingsranged from 1 (strongest evidence, for instance reports ofclinical decision rules and high quality validation studies)to 5 (weakest evidence, often expert opinion). Studiesreceiving CEBM scores of 5 were excluded.Studies were then graded according to the QualityAssessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS)tool [24], which was modified for the purpose of thereview. This tool considers 14 criteria relevant to diagnostic studies accounting for bias (items 3 to 7, 10 to 12),variability (items 1 and 2) and reporting (items 8 and 9).Items 4 (regarding the time period between index andreference test) and 7 (regarding the independency of thereference test) were omitted with regard to the selectioncriteria and the previously applied CEBM criteria. Additionally, item 3 (regarding the ability of the reference testto correctly classify the target condition) was applied toCT findings, ICI and neurosurgery separately.Data analysisAlthough extracted data regarding the first clinical question, predictors of CT findings, ICI and neurosurgery,could theoretically be summarized in a meta-analysis, thetask force decided a priori not to perform such an analysisfor the purpose of development of the guidelines, independent of heterogeneity between studies. We felt combiningthe data in this way could mislead the working group inthe consensus process and opted to instead presentuncombined data for studies including their quality assessment. We therefore calculated individual positive likelihood ratios (PLR) and negative likelihood ratios (NLR) foreach risk factor with respect to the corresponding reference test (CT, ICI or neurosurgery) and the prevalenceof both the reference test and the risk factor in the--- Page 6 (LEFT) ---Undén et al. BMC Medicine 2013, 11:50http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/11/50population. We felt that these indices would represent themost relevant clinical applications for the working groupwhen considering the recommendations. For the secondclinical question, we presented only descriptive analysis.Evidence summary and recommendations draftRecommendations were formed by the task force (JU, TI,BR) based upon the evidence in accordance with theGRADE system [20,25]. This system is increasingly beenused in the development of recommendations and allowsconsideration of aspects other than level of evidence indetermining the strength of a recommendation [25].Clinical predictors were chosen based upon the summarized evidence (see Additional file 1, Table S1). Focus wasput on the more severe outcome variables (need for neurosurgery being of critical importance), but ICI and anyCT findings were also considered, especially in caseswhere the evidence concerning neurosurgery was poorand/or inconsistent. We also considered the prevalenceof the risk factors in the studied cohorts. Risk factorsrelatively common in a population would lead to manyCT scans and these risk factors would therefore need toshow high predictive abilities to be included.The summarized quality of evidence, from studiesforming the basis of a recommendation, was graded fromhigh quality to very low quality, see Table 1. Evidencewas initially considered high quality when derived fromcohort studies reporting patients with diagnostic uncertainty and appropriate reference standards, as describedearlier. Evidence could be downgraded due to risk of bias(selection (population indirectness), verification, observerand reporting), outcome indirectness (balance betweenthe presumed influence on patient outcome of the testresult (combination of risk factors) in relation to thecomplications and resource use of the test), inconsistency(large differences in prevalence of reference tests, prevalence of risk factors, PLR or NLR) or differing generalresults between studies), impreciseness (studies withsmall number of patients and few positive CT, ICI orneurosurgery events) and suspicion of publication bias(small number of studies, industry funding).Recommendations, relating to the clinical questions,were classed as strong (we recommend...), weak (wesuggest...) or uncertain (we cannot recommend...) (seeTable 1). For this process, careful consideration was againmade to risk/benefit aspects of patient-important outcomes(need for neurosurgery was classed as the most important)in relation to test results, including assumptions for pretestprobabilities (different magnitudes of risk for a positivereference result of CT, ICI or neurosurgery) for differentpatients, quality of evidence, uncertainty of the preferencesand values for outcomes and the use of health careresources. Therefore, it is theoretically possible to achieve a--- Page 6 (RIGHT) ---Page 5 of 13strong recommendation despite low quality evidence or viceversa.Recommendations and guideline developmentBased upon the recommendations, a draft for the updatedguidelines was constructed by the task force. Followingthis, a modified Delphi process was used [26], involvingthe working group previously described, consisting of atleast two rounds of consensus. The a priori criteria todetermine acceptance, rejection or lack of consensus areshown in Table 2. In the first round, the recommendations, including data from included studies with CEBM,QUADAS and GRADE evaluations together with a guideline draft were sent via email to the working group.Ratings, including feedback, were anonymously collected.The task force adjusted the recommendations and draftbased upon these responses. Then, in conjunction with a2-day SNC meeting in September 2012 outside Copenhagen, Denmark, results were discussed and suggestions forimprovements made. Following this, the second round ofDelhi was completed via email. Additional rounds wouldbe undertaken if necessary. The task force and workinggroup were urged to consider the GRADE aspects previously mentioned, especially health risk/benefit aspectsincluding resource use, as well as side effects and risks(misclassification of patients), at all stages of development.The final guidelines were evaluated, independently ofthe task force and working group, in the ED of SkaneUniversity Hospital, Malmo, Sweden, to judge clarity ofpresentation and ease of use. Simultaneously, the guidelines were evaluated by important stakeholders fromspecialties directly involved in the everyday managementof these patients. Feedback was documented and appropriate changes were made, if necessary, but only to consensus aspects. Finally, the working group reapprovedthe guidelines after presentation of changes and feedback from the evaluation.Implementation, monitoring and future updatesGuidelines will only be successful if they are used correctlyand on a wide scale. Previous experience with the 2000Scandinavian guidelines has shown poor compliance andvarying degrees of implementation success [27,28]. Implementation and monitoring strategies were discussed withinthe working group in order to facilitate long-term successfuluse of the guidelines in Scandinavia. Focus was put on overcoming barriers to application and effectively using availableresources. The working group also outlined a procedureand approximate time period for updating the guidelines.ResultsThe search and selection process is shown in Figures 2and 3 for the two clinical questions.--- Page 7 (LEFT) ---Undén et al.

These studiesincluded 226,606 individual patients. The level of evidenceaccording to CEBM was variable and overall judged to bemoderate (see Additional file 2, Table S2). Quality assessment with the QUADAS tool (see Additional file 3, TableS3) showed substantial bias in the studies, particularlyconcerning the representativeness of the studied population (selection bias, criteria 1), blinding of the index test(criteria 8) and withdrawals (criteria 12). Studies scoredbetter regarding the reporting of selection criteria (criteria2) and most had acceptable reference standards (criteria3), although they were often described poorly.Clinical predictors, with according source study, PLR,NLR, reference test prevalence and risk factor prevalence are shown in Additional file 1, Table S1.With regard to the second clinical question, we found21 studies adhering to our inclusion criteria (see Additional file 4, Table S4 for evidentiary information andrelevant results). The CEBM rating was generally low,with several studies reporting non-independent referencestandards (see Additional file 4, Table S4).

Other consistent weaknesses of the studies were a lackof reference test description and blinding (see Additionalfile 5, Table S5 for details).RecommendationsBased upon the evidence, drafts for recommendations,guidelines and written discharge advice were constructedby the task force. These, with according presentation ofthe evidence (Additional files 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, Tables S1-S5),were reviewed by the working group using the predefinedDelphi process. Following round 1 (see Table 3), discussion in the working group concerned points 4 and 7. Sincepoint 7 regarded the overall guidelines, minor adjustmentswere also made to other points. Only consensus pointswere changed (the risk factors shunt-treated hydrocephalus and the combination of age >65 and antiplatelet medication were added, discharge advice was simplified,monitoring routines were adjusted and the graphical layout of the guidelines was improved).Following round 2 (see Table 4), consensus was achievedin favor of all recommendations, the guidelines and thedischarge instructions.

However, studies consistently show that low S100B levelscan be used to select patients who do not need a CTscan and, hence, may save valuable resources. Of thefew missed patients in the literature, almost all are nonneurosurgical lesions. Some studies include risk factorssuch as GCS 13, anticoagulation and focal neurologicaldeficits in the inclusion criteria. The working group,--- Page 10 (RIGHT) ---Page 9 of 13however, found these risk factors to be too predictive ofintracranial injury.This recommendation may seem conflicting withrecommendation 1, above. However, S100B is recommended as an option for reducing unnecessary CTscans in a subgroup of Mild head injury patients withlow risk for intracranial complication and/or neurosurgical intervention.(3) We recommend that adult patients after minimaland mild head injury with GCS 15 and without risk factors (loss of consciousness, repeated (≥2) vomiting,anticoagulation therapy or coagulation disorders, posttraumatic seizures, clinical signs of depressed or basalskull fracture, focal neurological deficits) can be discharged from the hospital without a CT scan (moderatequality, strong recommendation).The evidence was initially of high quality but wasdowngraded due to limitations in study design (mostlyselection bias), indirectness (outcomes were rarelyreported) and impreciseness (different magnitudes ofpredictive power of risk factors between studies). Theworking group felt, however, that the large proportionof patients with head injury would fall into this categoryand that a CT policy in all these patients would not behealth/economically viable considering the very low riskof intracranial injury, and even lower risk of neurosurgery, in this patient group. As previously discussed,older age and antiplatelet medication was again considered but rejected by the working group.Clinical question 2: ‘Which adult patients with minimal,mild and moderate head injury need in-hospitalobservation and/or a repeat head CT?’(1) We suggest that all adult patients after head injurywith GCS ≤13, clinical signs of depressed or basal skullfracture, anticoagulation therapy or coagulation disorder,post-traumatic seizure or focal neurological deficitshould have a CT scan and be admitted to hospital forobservation, irrespective of CT findings (low quality,weak recommendation).The evidence was sparse and also of low quality due tostudy limitations (selection bias) and inconsistency infindings. The working group felt that it would not begood clinical practice to discharge patients with any ofthese risk factors, despite the low quality of evidence.(2) We recommend that repeat CT scans should be performed in patients with neurological and/or GCS (≥2points) deterioration (low quality, strong recommendation).The evidence was of moderate quality and was downgraded due to serious limitations in study design andsome inconsistency. Most of the evidence indicates thatroutine repeat CT of these patients with or without CTfindings is unnecessary in the absence of clinical deterioration, specifically deterioration of GCS >2 points and/or--- Page 11 (LEFT) ---Undén et al.

Clinical aspects such as anticoagulation andpersistent neurological findings were discussed but theworking group could not reach consensus on a recommendation for follow-up scans in these patients.GuidelinesBased upon the recommendations, guidelines were constructed. The addition of shunt-treated hydrocephaluswas based upon consensus in the working group withlittle evidence to support this. The working group discussed risk factors relating to trauma mechanism andmultitrauma injuries but found these difficult to recommend, mainly due to practical issues with clinical application. We considered serious extracranial injuries(defined as Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS) >3 to anyorgan system, for instance large (for example, femur)fractures or serious thoracic or abdominal injuries) as arisk factor due to the probability of a higher magnitudeof trauma, need for extracranial CT and the poorerprognosis of brain injury in these patients. However, wefinally decided to omit this as a risk factor primarily dueto the difficulty of classifying this risk factor in a busyclinical scenario. Additionally, predictive ability was generally only moderate for these risk factors. Also, loss ofconsciousness was expanded to suspected/confirmedloss of consciousness, as it is often difficult to confirmthis finding in the clinical setting. Patients who couldnot clearly deny any loss of consciousness should beclassed as suspected. Finally, the working group couldnot recommend older age or antiplatelet medication asindividual risk factors due to the unacceptable CTincrease such a recommendation would cause, in combination with only moderate predictive abilities. However,consensus was reached to combine these into one riskfactor, namely age ≥65 years and antiplatelet medication.Written instructions for patients being discharged wereadapted from the 2000 guidelines with consideration ofthe National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE)instructions [29] and a proposal for evidence-basedinstructions from Fung et al. [30], (see Additional file 6,Figure S1). With the Scandinavian setting in mind, thedischarge sheet was heavily simplified for clarity. Observation and monitoring routines for admitted patientswere based on consensus in the working group. We discussed the intensity of monitoring routines in relation tothe severity of the complications and burden on hospitalwards and finally decided that these should be relativelyfrequent shortly after trauma (the first 4 h) with de-escalation over time. Reasonably, most admitted patients willarrive to a ward after at least 4 h and hence already havepassed the 15-minute interval period. Also, these monitoring routines will only be used in small minority of--- Page 11 (RIGHT) ---Page 10 of 13patients as moderate and high-risk patients are relativelyuncommon and other patients should preferentially havea CT.Feedback from ED evaluation and from stakeholdersresulted in minor changes to wording and generalappearance of the guidelines. All stakeholders and theworking group approved the final version, see Additionalfile 7, Figure S2.Implementation, monitoring and future updatesThe working group decided on implementation by SNCmembers in their respective countries. This would beperformed through a combination of written and oralpresentations in national medical journals and nationalmeetings, respectively. We discussed barriers to implementation and decided that the most important of thesewas probably the absence of sufficient education concerning head injury management in Scandinavia. Wewould attempt to further facilitate implementation byprinting flyers and placards with the guidelines and tosend these to Scandinavian hospitals. We would alsoinitiate national training initiatives within the respectiveScandinavian countries.With respect to monitoring aspects, the working groupdecided to plan a questionnaire to Scandinavian physicians treating head injury to determine the present use ofguidelines, similar to previous efforts [31]. At 1 year following implementation, a follow-up questionnaire will besent out to establish changes in management routines.We will also initiate studies examining compliance withthe guidelines, as previously established in Norway[27,28], and attempt to improve insufficient use of theguidelines depending on these results. Finally, we willinitiate a prospective validation study, also comparing theperformance of our guidelines with other guidelines,decision rules and, importantly, unstructured physicianjudgment [32].The working group decided that an update of theguidelines would be necessary in 2015. This wouldinclude evidence updates concerning the clinical questions addressed in the present update and would furtherexamine the observation and monitoring routines foradmitted patients.DiscussionSince 2000, considerable evidence has emerged concerning the initial management, particularly risk factors forCT selection, of minimal, mild and moderate head injury.The work presented here is, in contrast to our previousguidelines, confined to adults but a similar effort regarding management of children is underway. Although theseguidelines can theoretically be used in any setting, theywere designed with the Scandinavian emergency care setting in mind. They are also designed to primarily identify--- Page 12 (LEFT) ---Undén et al. BMC Medicine 2013, 11:50http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/11/50patients needing neurosurgical or medical intervention,with traumatic CT findings being the secondary identification goal.In summary, the evidence was of reasonable qualityreferring to the predictive ability of risk factors for complications following head injury in these patients. Unsurprisingly, many of the risk factors included here are alsofound in other guidelines and decision rules [6,9-11,29,33].However, several differences can be noted. We found thatthe predictive power of amnesia was too low to beincluded. This risk factor was present in the SNC guidelines from 2000, mostly due to the difficultly in ruling outloss of consciousness in some patients. For this reason, weinclude suspected loss of consciousness as a risk factor.Risk factors such as intoxication, trauma above the clavicles, nausea, vertigo and headache were not includeddue to poor predictive ability combined with a high prevalence of these factors in the head injury population.The working group found injury mechanisms complicated to use practically in initial management anddecided not to include these as risk factors.Older age, most often defined as ≥60 or ≥65 years, isoften included in other guidelines. The predictive ability ofthis risk factor was only moderate and there was considerable uncertainty in the group with regard to patientimportant outcomes and resource use. The number ofpeople in older age groups in industrialized countries isincreasing [34] and the increased CT rate that would beassociated with this risk factor was deemed unacceptable.Also, the risk factor is common in the head injury cohorts,with between 10% and 45% of patients being over 65 yearsof age in reported cohorts of mild [10,35-38] and moderate [39] TBI. Fabbri et al. recently presented results considering the combination of older age and antiplateletagents [40]. Despite the lack of good evidence for thiscombination, consensus was reached to include age ≥65years in combination with any antiplatelet agent as a riskfactor. It is reasonable to expect that the combinationwould be more predictive of complications after headinjury and result in a smaller CT rate increase when compared to the risk factors used individually. Additionally, ithas been suggested that antiplatelet medication may be atleast partly responsible for the higher risks for intracranialcomplications seen after head injury in older patients [40].Shunt-treated hydrocephalus was added purely basedon consensus, with evidence derived from expert opinionin the group. We acknowledge the poor evidence-basedbackground to this decision but this patient group isuncommon and will not lead to a noticeable increase inCT scanning.Evidence concerning repeat CT was reasonable but lacking concerning both written discharge advice and observation routines. These aspects were therefore based heavilyupon consensus with special weight put on adaptation to--- Page 12 (RIGHT) ---Page 11 of 13the Scandinavian health care system. Since in-hospitalobservation consumes valuable resources, there is a needfor stronger evidence examining the need and magnitudeof these routines.For the first time, a brain biomarker has been introduced into clinical practice guidelines. Using a low cutoff of 0.10 μg/l, the biomarker has shown considerableability to predict the absence of CT pathology and neurosurgical intervention [36,41,42]. This negative predictionis welcomed since all other risk factors are of positivepredictive nature. S100B allows for a safe reduction inCT scans in a subpopulation of patients with mild headinjury. In order to maintain the theoretical safety andcost-saving ability, the biomarker should primarily notexhibit false negative results. Also, the biomarker shouldonly be taken in patients that would usually receive a CTscan and the fraction of negative S100B results (belowcut-off) should be as large as possible. S100B is clinicallyunspecific [43,44] and has a short half-life [45]. Therefore, patients with extracranial injuries and those seekingcare more than 6 h after trauma are not good candidatesfor S100B sampling due to a risk of false positives andnegatives, respectively. Some patients have risk factorswith higher predictive abilities and also factors thatwould usually warrant admission irrespective of CT findings. This group is therefore also not suitable for S100Bsampling. Despite the relatively good evidence for S100Bin this setting, biomarkers have historically had differenteffects in actual management and the clinical impact andhealth economic implications may alter future recommendations. Based upon the current evidence and clinicalsetting, however, this biomarker should safely reduceresource use if used correctly since low levels are veryuncommon in patients needing neurosurgical intervention in this setting.There are limitations to the process outlined in thispaper. Although the recommendations are based uponevidence, there were elements of consensus input to thefinal guidelines. This is inevitable when dealing withthese injuries and we attempted to minimize the negativeeffects of this through our stringent and extensive methodology using the best available tools. Particularly, theGRADE system [20] allows consideration of other important aspects other than the level of evidence in recommendations. The derivation and validation of predictiverisk factors as performed by other authors [6,10,18]would hardly be feasible in Scandinavia and would onlyaccount for one aspect of the management guidelines.Our methodology was judged as the most feasible considering the target population. However, external clinicalvalidation of our guidelines is welcomed and would naturally support successful implementation.Finally, these guidelines are, by definition, guidelinesand should be utilized accordingly. They are primarily--- Page 13 (LEFT) ---Undén et al. BMC Medicine 2013, 11:50http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/11/50designed as evidence and consensus-based guidance forphysicians who are not experts in the field. Physicianswho have considerable experience with these patientsshould naturally be allowed to defer from the guidelinesaccording to clinical judgment.ConclusionsWe present guidelines for initial management of adultswith minimal, mild and moderate head injury based upona thorough evidence and consensus-based methodology.The guidelines are primarily designed to detect complications after head injury needing either neurosurgical ormedical intervention. They can be applied to all adultpatients and include aspects such as CT and admissionselection, repeat CT selection, monitoring routines anddischarge aspects. However, we suggest external validation before they are widely implemented. Furthermore,areas with poor evidence, such as clinical monitoringroutines for patients following head injury, should beaddressed in future studies.
