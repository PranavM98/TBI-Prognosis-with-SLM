chunk_5_LEFT,"Introduction
Trauma is the leading cause of death and disability in 
children and young adults in New South Wales and 
closed head injuries cause a significant proportion of this 
burden.1, 2 Closed head injury may result in lifelong physical, 
cognitive, behavioural and social dysfunction for patients 
which in turn may place major social and financial burdens 
on their families and society.3 Recent Australian figures 
indicate there are approximately 150 patients per 100,000 
population admitted to hospital each year with closed head 
injuries.3-5 Worldwide figures suggest an incidence range 
of 200-350 per 100,000 population per year for patients 
with closed head injury with mild head injury accounting 
for 80%.6 Despite the fact that closed head injuries are 
common, the classification and management of closed 
head injures remains surprisingly controversial and subject 
to variation in clinical practice.6-10 Due to the large numbers 
of patients involved it has been estimated that even 
small improvements in closed head injury management 
could have significant impact.11 Furthermore, it has been 
suggested that the greatest improvements can be made 
in the better management of those patients with mild to 
moderate head injury rather than those with severe head 
injury.12 
Much of the controversy that exists about closed head 
injury management stems from the combination of a lack 
of uniformity in definitions with a paucity of large well 
designed studies in the area.11, 13, 14 ‘Head injury’ is typically 
used to describe the initial clinical presentation whilst 
‘traumatic brain injury’ or “concussion” are used to describe 
the subsequent functional outcome. The terms “mild head 
injury”, “mild traumatic brain injury” and “concussion” are 
largely interchangeable and which term is used depends on 
whether you are examining emergency medicine, trauma, 
rehabilitation or sports medicine literature. It is difficult to 
find two studies that define mild head injury in exactly the 
same way so comparison of data can be difficult.6, 8-10, 13
Similarly, comparison of data in moderate to severe head 
injury studies is made difficult because controversy exists 
about how and when best to apply Glasgow Coma Scale 
(GCS) to sedated or intubated patients.15 Perhaps most

chunk_5_RIGHT,"significantly there have been very few large prospective 
randomised controlled trials of sufficient power and quality 
to guide management.11, 13, 14 However, in the past few 
years there has been some progress in working toward 
uniform definitions and some better quality trials and metaanalyses have been published.6, 8-10, 15-35 
The variety of clinical practice observed worldwide 
cannot be explained solely by the lack of uniformity of 
definitions and good quality studies. Much of the variation 
in management strategies between the USA, Canada, 
Europe and Australasia is driven by local issues such as 
the availability of resources, the medico-legal environment 
and in recent years the concerns about the potential harm 
from CT radiation.6, 36, 37 Thus the USA has higher rates of 
CT scanning for mild head injuries compared to Canada, 
Europe and the UK. Even within countries and within 
institutions, considerable variation in practice has been 
shown to exist.7, 12, 35, 38 Whilst some variation in clinical 
practice is to be expected, the introduction of clinical 
practice guidelines can potentially improve care and ensure 
adequate access to resources for more isolated areas.6, 35 
Furthermore, clinical guidelines can potentially reduce 
unnecessary tests and hospital admissions for mild head 
injury patients by identifying those patients at low risk of 
neurosurgically significant lesions.6, 13, 33-35 
Scope of the guideline
The guideline is intended for use by clinicians managing 
patients with closed head injury in major and regional 
trauma services, and urban and rural hospitals. The 
guideline is concerned with the initial care of the mild, 
moderate and severely head injured patient. The guideline 
will make evidence based recommendations on the 
diagnosis, resuscitation, and disposal of patients with closed 
head injuries.",5,RIGHT,277,Page 5 (RIGHT)
chunk_6_LEFT,"The initial management plan for adults is based upon 
recommendations to be followed subject to the clinician's 
judgement in each case.
The recommendations however, are not prescriptive nor 
are they rigid procedural paths. It is recognised that the 
recommendations may not suit all patients in all clinical 
situations. They are intended to provide a clinically practical 
approach to the initial management of closed head injuries 
based on the current best available evidence. However, as 
with all guidelines, it should be remembered that they are a 
clinical tool and should not replace clinical judgement. The 
guideline relies on individual clinicians to decipher the needs 
of individual patients.
All recommendations regarding pre-hospital care should be 
read and considered in conjunction with the Ambulance 
Service of NSW.

children can be found at http://www.health.nsw.gov.au/

Aims and objectives
The guideline is intended to assist clinicians throughout 
NSW in delivering optimal care to patients with closed head 
injury. It aims to provide information to support clinical 
decision making, rather than dictate what decisions should 
be made.
The clinical questions addressed:
1 What is the deﬁ nition of a mild head injury?
2 What are the clinically important complications of mild head injury?
3 How should patients with mild head injury be assessed?
4 Which patients with mild head injury require a CT scan?
5 What should be done with high risk mild head injury patients when CT scan is unavailable?
6 What should be done when patients with mild head injury deteriorate? 
7 When can patients with mild head injury be safely discharged?
8 What discharge advice should be provided?
9 What are the proven treatments for patients with moderate head injury?
10 What are the proven treatments for patients with severe head injury?
11 When should patients with closed head injury be transferred to hospitals with neurosurgical facilities?
12 What analgesia should patients with closed head injury receive? 
13 Which patients with closed head injury should receive anti-convulsants?
PAGE 4  Initial Management of Closed Head Injury in Adults, 2nd Edition  NSW HEALTH",6,LEFT,347,Page 6 (LEFT)
chunk_6_RIGHT,"The broad objectives of the guideline are to reduce 
morbidity and mortality in adult patients with closed head 
injury by providing clinicians with practical evidence based 
recommendations to assist them in managing such patients. 
It is also hoped that the guidelines may prevent unnecessary 
diagnostic tests and hospital admissions especially in the 
mild head injury group. 
The process of constructing the guideline began 
with the clinicians on the Trauma Clinical Guidelines 
Committee posing a series of questions about the initial 
management of closed head injuries. The final questions 
were derived from the guideline priority areas identified 
by the committee; that is, the management of mild head 
injuries and the timing of transfer of patients with closed 
head injury from centres with limited resources. The 
initial management of patients with moderate to severe 
head injury was felt to be less controversial. This edition 
also includes recommendations in relation to the use of 
analgesia and anti-convulsants.
An extensive description of the methodology used for this 
guideline can be found at Appendix 8, together with the 
search terms used at Appendix 9.",6,RIGHT,179,Page 6 (RIGHT)
chunk_7_LEFT,"Defining closed head injury
This guideline uses the terms ‘closed head injury’ and ‘mild, 
moderate or severe head injury’ to identify and classify 
patients on arrival to hospital. The outcome following 
presentation with a ‘closed head injury’ will vary from rapid 
complete recovery to a mixture of structural lesions and 
functional deficits ranging from trivial to life threatening. 
The terms “concussion” and “traumatic brain injury” refer 
to the patient outcome following their initial presentation 
with a “closed head injury” and are retrospective 
diagnoses. Important functional deficits following ‘closed 
head injury’ range from post concussion symptoms and 
post traumatic amnesia to a variety of disabling persistent 
physical-cognitive-behavioural-social sequelae. 
Many patients who suffer a “mild head injury” will have 
“mild concussion symptoms” or “mild traumatic brain injury 
symptoms”. If these acute “concussion” symptoms persist 
beyond the first few hours they are usually referred to as 
“post concussion symptoms”. The term “post concussion 
symptoms” is used to describe the clinical symptoms of 
mild brain injury that mild head injury patients may suffer 
for a few days to weeks following their injury. In the

chunk_7_RIGHT,"situation where multiple post concussion symptoms persist 
for several months they are called a “post concussion 
syndrome”
As this guideline concentrates on the initial management 
of the patients presenting to hospital, it was felt that the 
term ‘head injury’ was more relevant to the initial clinical 
presentation than the term ‘traumatic brain injury’ that 
essentially refers to the subsequent functional outcome. It 
was also felt that the clinicians at whom this guideline is 
aimed would be far more familiar and comfortable with 
using the term ‘head injury.’ The definition of closed head 
injury is further discussed in Question 1.
Classification of closed head injury
This guideline has classified patients with initial GCS 14-15 
on admission as mild head injury. This system classifies 
patients with initial GCS score of 13 in the moderate head 
injury group due to the patients having similarly patterns of 
intracranial injury and cognitive behavioural sequelae. The 
following table gives a rough guide to classification and 
outcome.15, 39-43",7,RIGHT,161,Page 7 (RIGHT)
chunk_8_LEFT,"Changes from 2007 edition
Background
The first edition of this guideline was written in 2005 
using evidence available until December 2004. The aim of 
this new edition is to review the evidence published since 
December 2004 and to provide some additional information 
on specific topics including the role of anticonvulsants and 
analgesics in the management of closed head injury. 
The aim of the original guideline was to provide a clinically 
practical evidence based guideline that summarised 
the initial management of adult closed head injury. It 
was piloted by the NSW Institute of Trauma and Injury 
Management (ITIM) and then formally adopted and 
published by NSW Health in January 2007. There was a 
conscious effort by the initial guideline team to provide a 
clinically practical document with clinically useful resources 
such as algorithms, summaries and discharge advice sheets 
backed up by a detailed evidence review. The guideline 
team has continued the same principles for this update, 
incorporating feedback from clinicians to improve the 
guideline. The algorithms and mild head injury discharge 
sheets have been revised to reflect the changes in the body 
of the guideline and the feedback received. 
The guideline team would emphasise that this guideline is a 
clinical tool designed to assist clinicians and should be used 
to assist rather than replace the clinical judgement of an 
experienced clinician caring for an individual patient.
The information provided is based on the best available 
information at the time of writing, which is May 2010. 
These guidelines will be updated every five years and 
consider new evidence as it becomes available.
New evidence
Since 2004 there have been many new studies and 
guidelines published about the management of closed 
head injury. There have been some advances in our 
understanding of the assessment and treatment of 
closed head injury but these have been incremental and 
PAGE 6  Initial Management of Closed Head Injury in Adults, 2nd Edition  NSW HEALTH",8,LEFT,317,Page 8 (LEFT)
chunk_8_RIGHT,"evolutionary rather than revolutionary. The basic principles 
of management of closed head injury remain the same in 
2010 as they were five years ago. 
The following section briefly outlines the most significant 
advances in knowledge from the recent literature 
incorporated in this update. 
Definition of mild head injury
- Recent literature emphasises that significant intracranial 
injury may occur without loss of consciousness or 
amnesia
- Patients with initial GCS 13 have a significantly higher 
rate of intracranial injury and should not be considered 
as having mild head injury
Clinically important complications of mild head injury
- Recent literature emphasises that mild post concussion 
symptoms are common and that patients should 
receive appropriate discharge advice to assist recovery
- Acute neurosurgical complications are uncommon but 
important to identify
Assessment of patients with mild head injury
- Recent literature emphasises that if structured clinical 
assessment indicates the risk of intracranial injury is 
low, the routine use of CT scanning is not warranted 
and is potentially harmful.
- Structured clinical assessment should include initial 
clinical history and examination, serial clinical 
observations and clinical risk factor assessment to 
determine the need for CT scanning
- A variety of clinical decision rules have been developed 
to determine which patients are at higher risk of 
intracranial injury and require CT scanning. However, 
they all require that the clinician is familiar with their 
inclusion / exclusion criteria and should be used as 
tools to support clinical decision making, rather than 
dictate management
- Post traumatic amnesia testing in the emergency",8,RIGHT,253,Page 8 (RIGHT)
chunk_9_LEFT,"department, eg Abbreviated Westmead PTA Scale 
(A-WPTAS) can be useful in identifying patients with 
cognitive impairment at increased risk of structural 
lesions and post concussion symptoms.
Indications for CT scan for mild head injury
- Recent literature emphasises that patients can be risk 
stratified according to clinical risk factors and clinical 
decision rules. Patients who are classified as high risk 
should have CT scans to exclude clinically important 
intracranial lesions
- Significant head injuries can occur without loss of 
consciousness or amnesia and that the absence of 
these features should not be used to determine the 
need for CT scanning.
- Persistent abnormal mental status manifested by either 
abnormal GCS or abnormal alertness, behaviour or 
cognition is a strong indication for CT scanning 
- Known coagulopathy and particularly supratherapeutic anticoagulation are significant risk factors 
for intracranial injury and that these patients should 
have early CT scans and be considered for reversal of 
anticoagulation
- There have been several very large studies addressing 
this issue in the paediatric literature that have come up 
with very similar risk factors to the adult literature and 
have also confirmed that it is safe to discharge low risk 
patients without CT scanning.
Acute neurological deterioration
- Recommendations essentially unchanged
- Previously covered within guideline but now given 
separate question
 Discharge of patients with mild head injury
- Recent literature emphasises that patients can be safely 
discharged for home observation if structured clinical 
assessment reveals no clinical risk factors indicating the 
need for CT scanning or following a normal CT scan if 
indicated.
- Deterioration of mild head injury patients following 
a normal CT scan is rare. Caution is advised for 
patients with known coagulopathy and elderly patients 
where the risk of a delayed subdural haemorrhage is 
increased.

chunk_9_RIGHT,"Discharge advice for patients with mild head injury 
- New section to emphasise importance of discharge 
advice
- Recent literature emphasises that all patients with 
mild head injury should be given both verbal and 
written discharge advice covering symptoms and signs 
of acute deterioration, when to seek urgent medical 
attention, lifestyle advice to assist recovery, information 
about typical post concussion symptoms and reasons 
for seeking further medical follow up. As with all 
discharge advice this should be time specific and action 
specific.
- An improved version of the original mild head injury 
advice sheet associated with this guideline has been 
developed and is now available in several languages.

Note 
The presence of multiple risk factors is more concerning than a single isolated risk 
factor. In most uncomplicated mild head injury patients clinical symptoms start to 
improve by 2 hours post injury and are returning to normal by 4 hours post injury. 
Clinical symptoms that are deteriorating or not improving by 4 hours post injury on 
serial observation such as abnormal alertness / behaviour / cognition, PTA, vomiting or 
severe headache are very concerning.
Abnormal CT scan
CT scan unavailable
Consider transfer for CT scanning particularly if:
- Persistent GCS <15.
- Deterioration in GCS.
- Focal neurological deficit.
- Clinical suspicion of skull fracture 
- Known coagulopathy (esp if INR>4)
-  Persistent abnormal alertness, behaviour, cognition, 
PTA, vomiting or severe headache at 4 hours post injury
Consult senior clinician and network neurosurgical service 
regarding further management and disposition. 
Continue clinical observations in hospital.
Explanatory notes for risk factors
1.  Using GCS<15 at 2 hours post injury allows clinical judgement for patients who present soon after 
injury or who have drug or alcohol intoxication. Drug or alcohol intoxication has not been shown to 
be an independant risk factor for intracranial injury but persistent GCS<15 is a major risk factor and 
mandates CT. 
2.  Clinical suspicion of skull fracture includes history of focal blunt assault or injury; palpable skull fracture; 
large scalp haematoma or laceration; signs of base of skull fracture – haemotympanum / CSF leak / 
raccoon eyes / Battles sign.
3.  Recurrent vomiting more concerning than isolated vomiting but both are indications.
4.  Known coagulopathy is both a strong indication for early CT scan and to check the INR. Early reversal of 
anticoagulation if abnormal CT scan and consider reversal if initially normal CT scan with high INR (>4) 
depending on clinical situation.
5.  Elderly patients have increasing risk of intracranial injury with increasing age; routine CT scanning 
indicated unless totally asymptomatic patient with no other risk factors.
6.  Brief generalised seizures immediately following head injury are not significant risk factors. Prolonged, 
focal or delayed seizures are risk factors for intracranial injury.
7.  Post traumatic amnesia may manifest as repetitive questioning or short term memory deficits and can 
be objectively tested using the A-WPTAS. PTA > 30 mins is a minor risk factor and PTA > 4 hours a 
major risk factor for intracranial injury.
8.  Abnormal alertness/behaviour/cognition detects subtle brain injury better than GCS and should be part 
of the bedside assessment. Family may help establish what is normal.
9.  Multi-system trauma – beware patient with unstable vital signs or distracting injuries or who receive 
analgesia or anaesthesia, as significant head injury is easily missed.
10. Clinical judgement required as to what is a large scalp haematoma or laceration.
11.  Dangerous - MVA ejection / rollover; pedestrians / cyclists hit by vehicle; falls >own height or five stairs; 
falls from horses / cycles etc; focal blunt trauma, eg bat / ball / club.
12.  Known neurosurgery/neurological impairment – conditions such as hydrocephalus with shunt or AVM 
or tumour or cognitive impairment such as dementia make clinical assessment less reliable and may 
increase risk of intracranial injury.
13.  Delayed presentation should be considered as failure to clinically improve during observation. For 
representation consider both intracranial injury and post concussion symptoms and have a low 
threshold for CT scanning if not done initially.",11,RIGHT,676,Page 11 (RIGHT)

What is the definition of a mild head injury?
Mild Head Injury Deﬁ nition
Strength of 
recommendation
A patient with an initial GCS score of 14-15 on arrival at hospital following acute blunt 
head trauma with or without a definite history of loss of consciousness or post traumatic 
amnesia.
Typical characteristics
- Direct blow to the head or acceleration / deceleration injury.
- Transient loss of consciousness or brief post traumatic amnesia.
- Transient abnormal alertness, behaviour or cognition.
- Rapid clinical improvement
- Neurosurgical intervention rare (1-3%)
- Abnormality on CT scan relatively uncommon (5-15%)
- Post concussion symptoms common.
- Long term functional outcome good.
Speciﬁ c exclusions:
- Clinically obvious penetrating head injury.
- Non-traumatic brain injury.
Risk Stratiﬁ cation
Patients may be classiﬁ ed into “high” and “low” risk groups based on the risk of suffering complications 
of their mild head injury. This risk stratiﬁ cation can be used to assist clinical judgement in determining 
the need for further assessment (eg CT scan), management and follow up. Stratiﬁ cation into “high” and 
“low” risk groups is based on the presence or absence of speciﬁ ed clinical risk factors identiﬁ ed by:
- initial clinical history
- initial clinical examination
- serial clinical observation
“Complicated” Mild Head Injury
A “complicated” mild head injury is a mild head injury resulting in one of the following:
- signiﬁ cant structural lesion on CT scan
- signiﬁ cant acute clinical symptoms
- signiﬁ cant post concussion symptoms
PAGE 12  Initial Management of Closed Head Injury in Adults, 2nd Edition  NSW HEALTH",14,LEFT,265,Page 14 (LEFT)
chunk_15_LEFT,"Recently published studies and guidelines use a variety of 
criteria to define mild head injury, which is variably referred 
to as either mild head injury or mild traumatic brain injury.6, 
8-10, 13, 31-35, 46-48 The most common variations concern 
the initial classification according to GCS and different 
requirements for loss of consciousness and post traumatic 
amnesia (summarised in Appendix 1). This variation in the 
literature makes comparison between studies difficult. 
The main reason for this variability is a uniform desire to 
identify those patients at higher risk of intracranial injury in 
what is a heterogenous but essentially low risk group. There 
is ample evidence to suggest that patients with an initial 
GCS of 13 should be considered as part of the moderate 
head injury group due to the frequency of intracranial 
lesions (25-38%) and cognitive-behavioural-social sequelae 
(see Evidence Table 1 and Appendix 2).9, 36, 43, 49-56 
Since 2004 the adult literature has clearly identified that 
patients may sustain significant head injuries without loss 
of consciousness or post traumatic amnesia.9, 33, 43, 47, 
57-59 Therefore, the presence of loss of consciousness or 
post traumatic amnesia should not be used to define mild 
head injury or guide management. In 2008 Jagoda et al, 
representing the American College of Emergency Physicians 
/ Centre for Disease Control, updated their definition of 
mild head injury to reflect the change in the evidence and 
now include patients with GCS 14 on initial assessment 
and have eliminated loss of consciousness or post traumatic 
amnesia as necessary inclusion criteria.9
Further risk stratification of mild head injury is then 
dependent on the presence of associated risk factors 
and different authors have different approaches. The 
approaches of some of the best quality studies and 
guidelines are summarised in Appendix 1. It is interesting 
to note that when all the initial GCS criteria, inclusion/
exclusion criteria and sub-classification systems are all 
taken into account, that the findings are very similar. These 
findings are that mild head injury is a heterogenous group 
with patients at higher risk of increased intracranial injury 
identified by persistently abnormal GCS and certain other 
risk factors.1, 6, 8-10, 13, 31-36, 47-54, 56-81 
It is important to recognise that these risk factors for 
intracranial injury do not necessarily predict the risk of 
post concussive symptoms which are the more common 
complication of mild head injury. It is important that 
doctors, patients and their families understand that the 
absence of a structural lesion on CT scan following a mild

What are the clinically important complications of mild head injury?
RECOMMENDATION
Strength of 
recommendation
The clinically important complications of mild head injury are:
- structural lesions on CT scan requiring acute neurosurgical intervention
- structural lesions on CT scan requiring hospital admission and/or neurosurgical consultation
- acute clinical symptoms requiring acute hospital admission
- post concussion symptoms causing disabling cognitive behavioural social sequelae
Structural lesions on CT scan requiring acute neurosurgical intervention are rare (1-3%).
Typical lesions include:
- acute extradural haematoma
- acute subdural haematoma
- depressed skull fractures
Structural lesions on CT scan requiring hospital admission and/or neurosurgical consultation are relatively 
uncommon (5-15%). Not all of these lesions will require hospital admission.
Typical lesions include:
- small intracranial haematomas/haemorrhages
- minor skull fractures
Clinicians and patients should be aware that the absence of a structural lesion on CT scan following 
mild head injury does not exclude the possibility of signiﬁ cant acute clinical symptoms or signiﬁ cant post 
concussion symptoms.
Acute clinical symptoms are common immediately following mild head injury but should be starting to 
improve in most patients within two to four hours of time of injury.
Common acute clinical symptoms include:
- post traumatic amnesia
- disorientation
- confusion
- drowsiness
- dizziness
- nausea
- vomiting
- headache
Patients with persistent acute clinical symptoms at four hours post time of injury require prolonged 
clinical observation and a CT scan should be performed (if not already done) to exclude a structural 
lesion. 
Patients with persistent post traumatic amnesia and/or other persistent signiﬁ cant acute clinical 
symptoms that are not improving require prolonged clinical observation and should be admitted to 
hospital even if their initial CT scan is normal.

chunk_17_LEFT,"RECOMMENDATION
Strength of 
recommendation
Post concussion symptoms are relatively common following mild head injury and may have 
signiﬁ cant cognitive-behavioural-social impact on patients and their families.
 
Many patients will have minor post concussion symptoms that will resolve within a few days while some 
patients will have more signiﬁ cant post concussion symptoms that will take a few weeks to resolve.
A small number of patients with mild head injury will have persistent disabling post concussion 
symptoms after 3 months and will require referral for brain injury rehabilitation assessment. Most of 
these patients will improve by 12 months.
Mild head injury patients with structural lesions on CT scan, a history of signiﬁ cant acute clinical 
symptoms or documented persistent post traumatic amnesia are at increased risk of post concussion 
symptoms but post concussion symptoms can occur in the absence of these features. 
The only interventions that have been shown to be beneﬁ cial for post concussion symptoms are 
education, reassurance and time. Therefore, it is important to provide education about post concussion 
symptoms to all mild head injury patients. All patients should be given written advice and advised to see 
a doctor if they are not feeling better within a few days of injury. 
Typical post concussion symptoms include:
- headaches
- dizziness
- fatigue
- memory impairment
- poor concentration
- mood swings
- behavioural changes
- sleep disturbance
- social dysfunction
Clinically important complications of mild head injury 
include both structural lesions and functional deficits. The 
most important structural lesions to identify are those 
requiring acute neurosurgical intervention. However, 
functional deficits resulting in cognitive-behavioural-social 
sequelae are far more common and may have significant 
impact on patients and their families. It is important that 
doctors, patients and their families understand that the 
absence of a structural lesion on CT scan following a mild 
head injury does not exclude the possibility of significant 
cognitive-behavioural-social sequelae.
Acute intracranial haematomas requiring acute 
neurosurgical intervention are the most dramatic and 
life threatening complications of mild head injury. 
The identification of structural lesions requiring acute 
neurosurgical intervention is the most important function 
of CT scanning because the presence or absence of 
Initial Management of Closed Head Injury in Adults, 2nd Edition  NSW HEALTH  PAGE 15",17,LEFT,370,Page 17 (LEFT)
chunk_17_RIGHT,"other structural lesions does not usually significantly alter 
outcome. However, multiple studies have shown that these 
neurosurgically significant lesions are relatively uncommon 
with incidences of 0.1-3.2% for GCS 15 and 0.5-6.5% 
for GCS 14 with most of the larger studies finding that 
acute neurosurgical intervention is required in less than 
1% of mild head injury patients (see Evidence Table 1 
and Appendix 2 for more detail).32, 33, 35, 36, 47, 49-53, 68, 74, 
77, 88-90 Other intracranial injuries and skull fractures are 
more frequently noted on CT scans but are usually only 
clinically important as indicators of the potential for clinical 
complications such as delayed intracranial haematomas, 
post traumatic seizures or post concussion symptoms.52,76 
Delayed acute intracranial haematomas requiring 
neurosurgical intervention are uncommon following normal 
CT scans (range < 0.1%).13, 14, 31, 39, 91, 92
There has been much debate in the literature about the",17,RIGHT,145,Page 17 (RIGHT)
chunk_18_LEFT,"importance of identifying abnormalities on CT scan that do 
not require clinical intervention, such as small intracranial 
haematomas and small non-depressed skull fractures. 
Clearly it is important to identify intracranial lesions that 
require neurosurgical intervention but is it beneficial to 
identify abnormalities on CT scan that do not require 
intervention? Concerns about radiation exposure and 
resource utilisation have influenced this debate. The trend 
in the literature is to develop strategies to identify clinically 
important lesions while minimising the number of CT 
scans performed. The outcome of this strategy is that a 
small number of minor abnormalities on CT will be missed. 
Therefore, not all abnormalities detected on CT scan should 
be regarded as clinically important.
Acute clinical symptoms associated with mild head injury 
are common and are sometimes referred to as concussion 
symptoms. These include abnormal mental status (alertness/
behaviour/cognition), post traumatic amnesia, vomiting, 
headache, dizziness and lethargy. In the majority of mild 
head injury patients, their acute clinical symptoms will 
rapidly improve and they may be left with mild post 
concussion symptoms or return to completely normal. In 
most patients these symptoms start to improve within a 
couple of hours of injury and it is unusual for significant 
symptoms to persist for more than 4 hours post time 
of injury. Persistent acute clinical symptoms indicate a 
significant functional injury and an underlying structural 
lesion should be ruled out with a CT scan. Patients with 
persistent acute clinical symptoms with a normal CT scan 
should be admitted to hospital for prolonged observation 
until their symptoms start to improve. They should have 
continued neurological observations and post traumatic 
amnesia (PTA) testing. 
Post concussion symptoms are relatively common following 
mild head injury and may have significant cognitivebehavioural-social impact on patients and their families.3, 
8-10, 76, 93-99 Post concussion symptoms include headaches, 
dizziness, fatigue, memory problems and other cognitive, 
behavioural and social dysfunction. Post concussion 
symptoms have been shown in some studies to occur in 
up to 25 - 50% of patients with mild head injury,3, 8, 10, 76, 
94-96, 98, 99 but in about 10% of cases they may persist with 
at times significant psychological overlay as post concussion 
syndrome.3, 8, 10, 76, 94, 98, 99 In an Australian study Faux et 
al100 found that 15% of patients with mild traumatic brain 
injury continued to complain of post traumatic headache 
at 3 months compared to 2% of controls. These symptoms 
usually resolve within three months. The cognitivePAGE 16  Initial Management of Closed Head Injury in Adults, 2nd Edition  NSW HEALTH",18,LEFT,418,Page 18 (LEFT)
chunk_18_RIGHT,"behavioural-social dysfunction caused by mild head 
injury can be quite disabling, and some researchers have 
suggested that the severity of impact on lifestyle makes the 
term ‘mild’ inappropriate for some patients.3, 98, 99 Patients 
with significant persistent post concussive symptoms 
should be referred to a brain injury rehabilitation service or 
neurologist by their GP (see Appendix 7).
Most of the studies looking at post concussion 
symptoms included patients with initial GCS 13-15 with 
either transient confusion or disorientation or loss of 
consciousness (<30 min) or PTA (<24 hours) who did not 
require neurosurgery. Therefore, they tended to exclude 
lower risk patients without loss of consciousness or amnesia 
and include higher risk patients with initial GCS 13 when 
compared to the definition of mild head injury used in 
this guideline. The inclusion of patients without loss of 
consciousness or amnesia and the classification of patients 
with initial GCS 13 as moderate head injury means that 
the incidence of post concussion symptoms may be less 
common in the patients classified as mild head injury in 
this guideline. However, Lannsjo et al96 in a population 
based study of patients with initial GCS 15 found that 
about 34% of patients reported multiple (3 or more on 
the Rivermead Questionnaire) significant ongoing post 
concussion symptoms at three months. Kraus et al95 found 
about 30% of their patients (GCS 13-15) had a similar 
frequency of multiple symptoms although it is interesting 
to note that about 20% of their control group of patients 
attending ED for other problems reported multiple 
symptoms. Kraus et al95 found that headaches, dizziness, 
forgetfulness and frustration were the Rivermead symptoms 
that best identified mild head injury patients from the 
controls. Clearly, post concussion symptoms occur in many 
mild head injury patients but it is difficult to define which 
patients will get multiple persistent symptoms due to the 
mild head injury as many symptoms are common to other 
conditions, as well as the general population. The findings 
of these recent studies again emphasised the importance 
of providing education and follow up information regarding 
post concussion symptoms to all patients with mild 
head injury as a significant minority may have persistent 
symptoms. 
Post concussion symptoms are relatively common following 
mild head injury and may have significant cognitivebehavioural-social impact on patients and their families. 
Mild head injury patients with structural lesions on CT scan, 
significant acute clinical symptoms or significant PTA are 
at increased risk of post concussion symptoms but post",18,RIGHT,406,Page 18 (RIGHT)

features. The only interventions that have been shown to

mild head injury patients. 
Further information on post concussion symptoms and 
The clinically important complications of mild head injury suggest that the management priorities should be:

How should patients with mild head injury be assessed?
RECOMMENDATION
Strength of 
recommendation
Mild head injury patients should be assessed by a process of structured clinical assessment involving a 
combination of:
- initial clinical history and examination
- serial clinical observations 
- CT scanning if clinically indicated by risk factors identiﬁ ed on initial or serial assessment
Serial clinical observation should include minimum hourly observations of :
- vital signs. 
- pupillary reactions 
- GCS 
- alertness / behaviour / cognition
- post traumatic amnesia (PTA) (eg A-WPTAS)
If patients have no signiﬁ cant risk factors for complications of mild head injury and are clinically judged 
to be “low risk” then they should be observed until at least four hours post time of injury. 
If patients have any signiﬁ cant risk factors for complications of mild head injury then they should 
continue to be clinically observed while further assessment is performed. 
Serial clinical observations should be continued on any mild head injury patients who fail to clinically 
improve at four hours post injury or who are found to have structural lesions on CT scan.
Assessment for PTA should be performed on all mild head injury patients in the emergency department. 
Mild head injury patients who are admitted to hospital because they have structural lesions, persistent 
PTA or clinical symptoms should have daily PTA testing until they are shown to be out of PTA.
Clinical assessment using clinical risk factors or clinical decision rules can identify those patients at 
increased risk of intracranial injury requiring further investigation.
CT scanning is indicated for those mild head injured patients identiﬁ ed by structured clinical assessment 
as being at increased risk of intracranial injury.
CT scanning is the most appropriate investigation for the exclusion of neurosurgically signiﬁ cant lesions 
in mild head injured patients
If structured clinical assessment indicates the risk of intracranial injury is low, the routine use of CT 
scanning is neither clinically beneﬁ cial nor cost effective.
Skull x-rays are not sufﬁ ciently sensitive to be used as a routine screening investigation to identify 
signiﬁ cant intracranial lesions.
PAGE 18  Initial Management of Closed Head Injury in Adults, 2nd Edition  NSW HEALTH",20,LEFT,362,Page 20 (LEFT)
chunk_21_LEFT,"Clinical history and examination remain the basis for the 
initial assessment of patients with closed head injury. 
However, additional clinical tools are available to assist in 
assessment and management. These clinical tools include 
Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), initial serial neurological 
observation, post traumatic amnesia (PTA) testing, 
clinical decision rules, CT scanning and prolonged clinical 
observation in hospital.
Glasgow coma scale
The Glasgow Coma Scale (Appendix 5) was originally 
developed by Teasdale and Jennett104 for the neurological 
observation of patients with prolonged coma. It was 
intended to ensure inter-observer reliability and to identify 
deterioration of patients over time. Since its original 
introduction its use has been extended such that it is now 
the standard tool for assessment of level of consciousness 
in many clinical settings. 
GCS is used both for the initial assessment and classification 
of closed head injuries and for serial assessment of closed 
head injuries. Initial GCS on admission to hospital is used 
to classify head injuries into the broad prognostic groups 
of mild (GCS 14-15), moderate (GCS 9-13) and severe 
(GCS 3-8). The Brain Trauma Foundation concluded that 
there is good quality evidence to relate initial GCS score 
to outcome.15 However, it must be noted that these are 
broad outcome measures and initial GCS is only about 75% 
accurate so treatment should be individualised.15
GCS is unreliable if measured before initial resuscitation 
and stabilisation of the ABCDE’s has been completed.15 
Fearnside et al105 identified that both intubation and 
sedation interfered with accurate assessment of initial 
GCS in more severely injured patients and there is lack 
of uniformity of approach to classifying GCS in these 
situations.
The other significant area of controversy relates to timing of 
initial GCS. In unstable patients requiring resuscitation, the 
optimal time to record initial GCS remains controversial.15, 
105 Similarly, in mild head injury patients the time of 
presentation related to time of injury will influence the 
initial GCS and therefore potentially influence clinical 
decision making in relation to CT scanning.6, 10, 31, 35 
Perhaps the most crucial point to note about initial GCS is 
that it cannot predict individual outcome for patients with 
similar GCS scores. Thus, an individual patient with an initial 
GCS of 14-15 may have a variety of outcomes including 
Initial Management of Closed Head Injury in Adults, 2nd Edition  NSW HEALTH  PAGE 19",21,LEFT,383,Page 21 (LEFT)
chunk_21_RIGHT,"no significant injury, long-term cognitive-behavioural 
dysfunction or a life threatening extradural haematoma.
This is particularly important for mild head injury patients 
because GCS primarily assesses the risk of structural lesions. 
Subtle cognitive changes are not well discriminated within 
the mild head injury group. This led to the development of 
the extended Glasgow Coma Scale and the Abbreviated 
Westmead PTA Scale that assess the duration of post 
traumatic amnesia as a means of identifying patients at 
increased risk of cognitive problems.106-109 Despite these 
limitations initial GCS on admission remains the standard 
method for initial classification of head injuries.
When assessing initial GCS in patients with head injury it is 
worthwhile considering time of injury. Clearly initial GCS for 
a given patient may vary depending on time of presentation 
to hospital. Few studies have related GCS to the time of 
injury with the exception of Stiell et al35 who found GCS 
<15 at two hour post injury was a significant predictor of 
intracranial injury for mild head injury patients. Most recent 
studies that have reported time of presentation have shown 
that mild head injuries present around 60 to 90 minutes 
post injury.31, 43, 54 An abnormal initial GCS taken within 
one hour of injury is therefore likely to overestimate the 
risk of intracranial injury in mild head injury patients who 
present early.
Prehospital GCS, motor score and return of orientation 
are other factors to consider when assessing initial GCS. 
Prehospital GCS was felt to be unreliable,110 but with 
more organised prehospital systems, it is gaining further 
attention.15, 111 Motor score is the best predictor of outcome 
of the GCS components.15 Orientation returns most 
commonly in the sequence of person, place then time.112 
The Glasgow Coma Scale is used as one of the parameters 
in serial observation of head injury patients. This is what 
it was originally designed for and what it is most useful 
for. Both the original studies and subsequent studies have 
validated its use in this fashion and, prior to the advent 
of CT scanning, alteration in GCS was the most useful 
tool in predicting intracranial injury.9, 104 Borg et al101 in 
a meta analysis for the World Health Organisation on 
mild traumatic brain injury concluded that in the absence 
of CT scanning that hospital observation for at least 24 
hours for patients with GCS 15 and other risk factors was 
a reasonable strategy. Currently, serial GCS remains a 
standard tool in the monitoring of head injuries when CT 
scanning is unavailable or when clinical symptoms persist",21,RIGHT,417,Page 21 (RIGHT)
chunk_22_LEFT,"despite normal CT scanning.
Summary
- Initial GCS scores are useful to classify closed head 
injuries into broad prognostic groups requiring further 
assessment and serial observation.
- Serial GCS scores are useful to observe the trend in 
clinical condition over time for all patients
- Serial GCS scores may be used as alternative to CT 
scanning in patients with mild head injury and GCS 15 
when CT scanning is not available
- Serial GCS scores are useful for identifying patients 
with significant risk of intracranial injury in:
  
-  patients with an initial abnormal GCS score who fail 
to improve
  
- patients whose initial GCS score deteriorates.
- Initial and serial GCS scores are not as valuable in 
excluding significant injury in:
  
-  patients with an initial normal GCS score who remain 
normal
  
-  patients with an initial abnormal GCS score who 
improve.
- Initial GCS should only be used for prognostic purposes 
after initial resuscitation and stabilisation of ABCDE’s.
- The motor component of the GCS is the best predictor 
of outcome 
- The extended GCS or Abbreviated Westmead PTA 
Scale which assess both GCS and duration of PTA are 
designed to help identify mild head injury patients 
at increased risk of post concussion symptoms by 
identifying more subtle cognitive changes.
Serial clinical neurological observation
Serial clinical neurological observations remain a standard 
tool for assessing mild head injury patients despite the 
advent of CT scanning. CT scanning is primarily used to 
identify structural abnormalities at a given point in time 
while serial neurological observations are used to monitor 
clinical condition over a longer period of time. Serial 
neurological observation typically consists of at least hourly 
pupillary reactions and GCS assessment in conjunction 
with vital signs. The symmetry of motor responses and a 
standardised orientation assessment should be routinely 
noted as part of the GCS. Neurological assessment should 
also include qualitative assessment of alertness, behaviour 
and cognition as this may identify more subtle neurological 
impairment. 
In mild head injury patients the primary aims of serial 
PAGE 20  Initial Management of Closed Head Injury in Adults, 2nd Edition  NSW HEALTH",22,LEFT,352,Page 22 (LEFT)
chunk_22_RIGHT,"neurological observation are the early identification of 
acute neurological deterioration and the identification and 
monitoring of persistent mild neurological deficits. Serial 
neurological observations remain the basic standard of care 
for the initial management of mild head injury patients and 
should be used in conjunction with clinical decision rules 
to determine the need for CT scanning and / or prolonged 
observation. The qualitative aspects of serial neurological 
observation may assist in identifying acute deterioration 
or subtle functional abnormality before there is a change 
in GCS. Subtle drowsiness, mild disorientation to time, 
inattention and mildly disorganised thought processes with 
subtle post traumatic amnesia can easily be missed by over 
reliance on GCS in a patient who is awake and orientated in 
person and place.
Controversy exists over the appropriate duration of serial 
neurological observation for both mild head injury patients 
who are improving and those who have persistent clinical 
symptoms or abnormalities on CT scan. Although four 
hours of initial neurological observations post injury are 
fairly standard following mild head injury, there is little 
evidence to support this. There is also some debate as to 
whether the initial period of observation should be until 
four hours post injury or for four hours following arrival 
at hospital. Studies that reported time of presentation 
showed that most patients present at one to two hours 
post injury. Clinically most uncomplicated mild head injury 
patients will start to improve within two to four hours post 
time of injury. Stiell et al35 demonstrated that GCS<15 at 
two hours post injury was one of the most significant risk 
factors for intracranial injury. Since this guideline has used 
these clinically important criteria, it was felt that the initial 
clinical observation period should also be based on time 
post injury rather than four hours observation from the 
time of arrival at hospital. It is important that patients who 
present one hour post injury are not treated the same as 
those who present at four hours post injury with “routine 
observations” for four hours. If the patient who presents 
at four hours post injury is not clinically improving then 
they are at increased risk of intracranial injury and warrant 
CT scanning whereas the same patient at one hour post 
injury probably only requires observation unless there is 
another strong indication for CT scanning eg suspected 
skull fracture, seizure, warfarin etc. The initial period of 
neurological observation should therefore be until at 
least four hours post time of head injury at which point 
clinical decisions should be made if they are not clinically 
improving.",22,RIGHT,422,Page 22 (RIGHT)
chunk_23_LEFT,"If the serial clinical neurological observations of patients 
with an initial GCS 15 at 2 hours post injury are improving 
or have returned to normal at four hours post injury then 
the evidence would suggest it is safe to discharge them for 
home observation if they have no risk factors indicating the 
need for CT scan or if they have an initial normal CT scan. 
There is no strong evidence to support a specific duration 
of time of observation. Observation until 4 hours post time 
of injury should be used as an initial guide. Patients with 
trivial injuries could be considered for earlier discharge 
by an experienced senior clinician and patients with high 
risk factors should be considered for longer periods of 
observation. 
If serial neurological observations are not improving at 
four hours post injury then serial neurological observations 
should be continued and clinical decisions need to be 
made about the need for CT scanning and/or admission 
to hospital for prolonged observation. The period of 
admission to hospital for prolonged observation is also 
controversial as there is little evidence to support the 
general recommendation of twenty four hours. This period 
of observation is derived from studies that show that 
clinical deterioration is unusual in mild head injury patients 
after twenty four hours. Indeed, prior to the advent of CT 
scanning serial clinical observation was the standard of 
care and the need for neurosurgical intervention in mild 
head injury patients was largely determined on the basis 
of clinical deterioration. The best location for prolonged 
neurological observation for lower risk patients is also 
debated because some studies have shown that admission 
to hospital does not guarantee that regular neurological 
observation will occur.53
If patients are not clinically improving or have abnormalities 
on CT scan that warrant hospital admission, then serial 
clinical observations should be continued. The duration 
of this time of observation remains poorly defined. 
Basically, clinical observation should be continued until 
clinical symptoms improve or until it is felt there is little 
risk of deterioration. This needs to be individualised but a 
minimum of 24 hours is normally recommended.101
Summary
- Serial neurological observation is a useful tool for the 
early identification of acute neurological deterioration 
and the identification and monitoring of persistent mild 
neurological deficits.

a minimum of hourly GCS assessment, pupillary 
reactions, PTA and vital signs. Neurological 
observations should also include qualitative assessment 
of alertness, behaviour and cognition to detect subtle 
changes in mental status not assessed by the Glasgow 
Coma Scale.
- Mild head injury patients should have initial serial 
neurological observations until at least four hours post 
time of injury at which point decisions about further 
management should be made.

on patients who are admitted to hospital for at least 
24 hours and until patients clinically improve and are

Post traumatic amnesia (PTA) testing
Amnesia for the event, short-term memory loss, 
anterograde amnesia and PTA are all terms used to 
describe the disruption of memory that typically results 
from a traumatic head injury. The different terms describe 
a continuum of memory disruption, and the use of the 
individual terms depends on the duration of memory 
loss and individual preference. Amnesia for the event 
is common and of little clinical significance. Retrograde 
and anterograde amnesia are typically used to refer to 
the duration of loss of memory for events preceding or 
following an injury. PTA is the period of time during which 
a person is unable to lay down new memories following 
an injury. PTA and anterograde amnesia essentially refer to 
the same phenomena but some patients may have memory 
for events yet still be unable to lay down new memories 
– the so called islands of memory. Stiell et al56 identified a 
duration of greater than 30 minutes of retrograde amnesia 
as being a significant risk factor for intracranial injury. 
Smits et al47 identified a duration of PTA of greater than 2 
hours as being a minor risk factor and greater than 4 hours 
as being a major risk factor for intracranial injury. Many 
studies have shown that persistent PTA is a significant risk 
factor for poor functional outcome in all grades of head 
injury. Any persistent inability to lay down new memories 
following blunt trauma is perhaps most simply referred to 
as PTA and the duration of PTA may be used to predict 
the risk of intracranial injury and the risk of persistent 
post concussion symptoms. PTA is the term that will be 
predominantly used in this guideline.",23,RIGHT,382,Page 23 (RIGHT)
chunk_24_LEFT,"While it has been identified that prolonged PTA is a risk 
factor for significant post concussion symptoms,3, 109 the 
standard tool for identifying PTA in NSW, the Westmead 
PTA Scale (Appendix 3), is designed to be used over several 
days. There has been considerable interest in developing 
bedside PTA screening tools to allow early prediction of 
which patients are at greatest risk of developing post 
concussion symptoms. A simple bedside test that can 
determine whether the patient is out of post traumatic 
amnesia at the time of the test would be beneficial for both 
emergency department testing and ward based testing. 
The Extended Glasgow Coma Scale and the Abbreviated 
Westmead PTA Scale are examples of tools developed to try 
to identify persistent PTA in mild head injury patients as a 
marker for increased risk of post concussion symptoms.106, 
109 Recent Australian studies have looked at using specific 
bedside tools such as the Revised Westmead Post Traumatic 
Amnesia Scale in the emergency department to better 
identify patients with persistent PTA so that these patients 
can be more closely followed up as they are more likely 
to suffer significant post concussion symptoms.106-108 The 
Abbreviated Westmead PTA Scale (A-WPTAS), developed 
and validated113 from the previously validated Revised 
Westmead PTA Scale, has been successfully trialled 
in various New South Wales emergency departments 
(Appendix 4).
From a practical point of view, all patients with mild head 
injury should be assessed for post traumatic amnesia. It 
is useful to assess the patient’s recall of events following 
their injury by asking specific questions such as what is 
their first clear memory, who helped them at the scene and 
how they got to hospital. This can be used to estimate the 
period of post traumatic amnesia (anterograde amnesia). 
Clinicians should also look for symptoms of post traumatic 
amnesia such as repetitive questioning, failure to remember 
clinical staff and inability to remember events during their 
hospital stay. A formal assessment tool like the A-WPTAS 
or a simple memory assessment technique such as three 
object recall can be used as a bedside screening test for 
post traumatic amnesia, to supplement the ‘history’ of 
amnesia for events. Patients who have persistent post 
traumatic amnesia should be considered for CT scanning, 
prolonged observation and close follow up. Mild head 
injury patients who are admitted to hospital because 
they have structural lesions, persistent PTA or clinical 
symptoms should have daily PTA testing until they are 
shown to be out of PTA.

- The identification of persistent PTA in mild head injury 
patients is a potentially useful marker for the risk of 
intracranial injury and the risk of developing post 
concussive symptoms.

presenting to hospital following mild head injury.

Clinical decision rules
Clinical decision rules are increasingly being used to 
assist clinicians in determining the need for particular 
investigations or management. By identifying individual risk 
factors and combining them to establish clinical decision 
rules, which are then prospectively validated, useful 
evidence based diagnostic tools to assist management can 
be developed. Well established clinical decision rules also 
include the NEXUS criteria for cervical spine assessment and 
the Ottawa Ankle Rules.114, 115
Although clinical decision rules are potentially very useful, 
clinicians need to be aware of the specific inclusion/
exclusion criteria used to develop them and the overall 
quality of the original studies before applying them to their 
patients.9, 48 The other important point for clinicians to 
consider is what level of risk they are prepared to accept. 
No clinical decision rule can entirely rule out a significant 
finding for an individual patient, and different clinical 
decision rules will have different levels of risk. In patients 
with mild head injury it is important to have high negative 
predictive value for ruling out significant intracranial injuries 
but this comes at a cost of lower specificity and therefore 
the need for more CT scanning. While all the clinical 
decision rules aim to rule out significant neurosurgical 
lesions, they have different approaches to the value of 
identifying intracranial lesions on CT scan that do not 
require intervention. Clearly it is important to identify 
intracranial lesions that require neurosurgical intervention, 
but is it beneficial to identify abnormalities on CT scan 
that do not require intervention? Concerns about radiation 
exposure and resource utilisation have influenced this 
debate. The trend in the literature is to develop strategies 
to identify clinically important lesions while minimising the 
number of CT scans performed. Essentially, if you want 
to do less CT scans you have to accept that you will miss 
some intracranial abnormalities that are unlikely to require 
intervention.",24,RIGHT,375,Page 24 (RIGHT)
chunk_25_LEFT,"Clinical decision rules for adult patients with mild head 
injury have been developed through studies of large 
cohorts of patients and prospectively applied to patients 
to determine their sensitivity, specificity and negative 
predictive value.31, 32, 35, 47, 48, 56, 58, 116 These studies aim to 
identify those patients at increased risk of intracranial injury 
and develop clinical decision rules about which patients 
require CT scanning or prolonged observation. The best 
studies should be well designed and prospectively internally 
validated in the original population and then externally 
validated by other groups in other populations. The main 
design features of these trials are summarised in Evidence 
Table 1 and Appendix 1. 
The most consistent findings of these studies are that 
abnormal GCS or mental status, clinical suspicion of skull 
fracture, focal neurological deficit, vomiting, coagulopathy 
and age > 65 are the best predictors of risk of intracranial 
injury. Other relevant predictors of risk include mechanism 
of injury, prolonged loss of consciousness, post traumatic 
amnesia, severe headache and seizure. Depending on their 
inclusion / exclusion criteria the authors used combinations 
of these risk factors to derive clinical decision rules of 
varying sensitivity and specificity (Evidence Table 1 and 
Appendix 1). At present, the findings of both Haydel et 
al32 and Stiell et al35 have been adopted as policy by the 
American College of Emergency Physicians (USA),9 whilst 
the findings of Stiell et al35 have been adapted by the 
NICE guidelines (UK).117 The other widely known clinical 
prediction rule is NEXUS II.58
Ibanez et al33 in 2004 attempted to prospectively identify 
clinical risk factors predicting intracranial injury and 
to assess the reliability of previously published clinical 
guidelines. They found that while clinical risk factors could 
not detect all intracranial injuries they could be used to 
detect clinically relevant lesions with a negative predictive 
value approaching 99%. They also concluded clinicians 
should be aware of the limitations of clinical decision rules 
when using clinical guidelines. An Australian study in 2004 
by Rosengren et al118 looked at applying the clinical decision 
rules developed by Haydel et al32 and Stiell et al35 to 
Australian practice and concluded that both had limitations. 
More recently an Australian study by Fong et al57 developed 
a local guideline by adapting the findings of Haydel et al32 
and Stiell et al35 and applying the resultant guideline to an 
Australian population with satisfactory results. The authors 
stressed the point that no clinical decision rule is infallible 
and that appropriate explanation and discharge advice was 
important.
Initial Management of Closed Head Injury in Adults, 2nd Edition  NSW HEALTH  PAGE 23",25,LEFT,426,Page 25 (LEFT)
chunk_25_RIGHT,"A recent review by Stein et al in 2009 compared most 
of the best known clinical decision rules for mild head 
injury by applying them retrospectively to a prospectively 
collected data base and found that they all performed well 
for identifying acute neurosurgical lesions but differed in 
their ability to identify other lesions and their predicted CT 
scan ordering rates. The authors concluded that NEXUS 
II probably performed the best but the accompanying 
editorial commented that it would be reasonable to use any 
of the clinical decision rules.48
The Canadian CT Head Rules are the most widely studied 
and have been externally validated several times. However, 
they were applied to GCS 13-15 patients, require loss of 
consciousness or amnesia and excluded unstable multisystem trauma, coagulopathy, pre hospital seizure and 
neurological deficit. The Canadian CT Head rule therefore 
needs to be adapted for application to the broader 
population or clinicians need to be fully aware of these 
limitations when using the original rule. The NEXUS II 
clinical decision rule has not been as extensively externally 
validated but has the advantage of being relatively simple 
to use and can be used for all patients with head injury 
as there were no exclusion criteria other than delayed 
presentation and both adult and paediatric populations 
were studied. From a clinically practical point of view the 
mnemonic “BEAN BASH” can be used to remember the 
NEXUS II indications for CT scanning patients with head 
injury at the bedside:
B – behaviour abnormal; 
E – emesis; 
A – alertness abnormal; 
N – neurological deficit; 
B – bleeding disorder; 
A – age>65; 
S – skull fracture suspected; 
H – haematoma scalp.
The most important point for any clinician to recognise 
is that clinical decision rules should be used as tools to 
support clinical decisions and should not override clinical 
judgement. If clinicians choose to use a clinical decision 
rule, they should be aware of the limitations and inclusion 
/ exclusion criteria of whichever clinical decision rule they 
decide to use.

- Clinical decision rules provide useful adjuncts to the 
assessment and management of mild head injury 
patients.",25,RIGHT,351,Page 25 (RIGHT)

Skull x-rays
The literature clearly identifies that both the clinical 
suspicion of skull fractures and the radiological evidence of 
skull fracture are significant risk factors for the presence of 
an intracranial lesion requiring neurosurgical intervention.6, 
31, 32, 35, 66, 74
If CT scanning is available, the current indications for skull 
x-rays are few. However, if CT scanning is unavailable, 
the role of skull x-rays as a screening test is less clear. A 
detailed meta analysis by Hofman et al66 concluded that 
whilst the presence of skull fracture greatly increased the 
risk of intracranial injury, the absence of a skull fracture 
did not rule it out (calculated sensitivity 38% calculated 
specificity 95%). In subsequent clinical guidelines, authors 
have differed as to whether skull x-rays should be used to 
detect patients at higher risk of intracranial injury. Jagoda et 
al9 argued that the sensitivity of skull x-ray is not sufficient 
to be used as a screening test. Vos et al10 and Servadei et 
al6 felt that in the absence of CT scanning, a positive skull 
x-ray can be useful to help allocate patients into higher risk 
groups for management purposes. On existing evidence, 
both approaches seem reasonable depending on local 
management guidelines. 
Summary
- Clinical evidence or suspicion of skull fracture is 
associated with increased risk of intracranial injury.
- Skull x-rays are not sufficiently sensitive to be used as a 
routine screening test to identify patients at increased 
risk of intracranial injury.
- Where CT scanning is unavailable, skull x-ray may 
be used as an adjunct to identify patients with skull 
fractures who are at greater risk of intracranial injury 
(but not to exclude intracranial injury).

chunk_26_RIGHT,"CT scanning
The widespread availability of CT scanning has greatly 
assisted the management of patients with head injuries. CT 
scanning has been particularly useful in identifying focal 
injuries in patients with altered level of consciousness or 
other risk factors. CT scanning is regarded as mandatory 
for all head injury patients with a persistent altered level 
of consciousness. However, the role of the CT scanning 
in a patient with mild head injury with a normal level 
of consciousness remains controversial. Multiple clinical 
decision rules have been developed to try to identify which 
patients should have a CT scan because of concerns about 
the routine use of CT scanning for all patients. Particular 
concerns about the routine use of CT scanning for mild 
head injury include the financial-resource burden, the 
potential hazards of radiation and the potential pitfalls 
of reliance on technology at the expense of clinical 
assessment.37, 71, 88, 119-123 Furthermore, CT scans do not 
identify patients who have cognitive dysfunction which is 
the most significant complication for most patients. The 
various pros and cons of CT scanning are summarised 
below:
- Early identification of patients with intracranial injuries 
requiring acute neurosurgical intervention
- Early identification of patients with other intracranial 
injuries requiring admission to hospital due to risk of 
deterioration 
- Identification of patients at low risk of deterioration 
and suitable for discharge
- Identification of patients with structural lesions 
indicating increased risk of post concussive 
symptoms.76
- Potential cost benefit due to early CT scanning allowing 
discharge home rather than hospital admission in some 
patients.119
Cons 
- Routine use of CT scanning for mild head injury 
potentially has a huge financial and resource impact 
given that more than 90% of scans are negative 
and less than 1% of scans indicate the need for 
neurosurgical intervention.13, 35, 124 
- Some patients, particularly the elderly or those with 
a known coagulopathy, may develop delayed focal 
neurosurgical lesions (especially subdural lesions) 
despite initial normal CT scanning.69, 125, 126",26,RIGHT,326,Page 26 (RIGHT)
chunk_27_LEFT,"- Early CT scans may not demonstrate intra-cerebral 
contusions which take time to become apparent on CT 
scanning.
- CT scanning will not demonstrate diffuse axonal injury 
in most patients.3
- Patients may suffer significant post concussive 
symptoms despite an initial normal CT scan.3, 94, 98, 99, 
- Routine use of CT scanning does not guarantee better 
identification of significant intracranial injuries if 
different institutions are compared.12, 37
- The risk of cumulative radiation exposure especially 
among children is of concern.120-123
- May delay definitive management of more significant 
injuries in multi system trauma patients.
CT scanning and radiation
There is increasing concern about the potential harm 
from radiation associated with CT scanning.122, 123, 127-130 
The main risk associated with radiation exposure from CT 
scanning is an increased lifetime risk of fatal cancer.122, 123 
There have also been concerns about the effects of 
radiation on cognitive development in children. Hall 
et al120 showed a significant reduction in educational 
performance in young children who received the equivalent 
dose of radiation of one or two CT heads for childhood 
haemangiomas. The risk posed by radiation is greatest 
in young children due to the relatively increased dose on 
more sensitive tissue and the increased time for a cancer to 
develop. Thus a person who has a CT scan as a child is at 
much greater risk than a person who has their first CT scan 
age 65 where the risk is very small. The risk posed by CT 
scan radiation is cumulative and is greatest in patients with 
chronic disease who have multiple scans. In patients with 
moderate to severe head injury there is a clear benefit from 
performing a CT scan because the probability of identifying 
a life threatening injury clearly outweighs the small increase 
in the lifetime risk of cancer. In the case of patients with 
mild head injury the risk of harm from radiation needs 
to be weighed against the relatively low probability of 
identifying a neurosurgically significant lesion on CT scan. 
This is of most concern in younger patients where the 
effective radiation exposure is higher, the time available for 
developing a cancer greater and the chance of cumulative 
lifetime exposure greater. Hence the interest in developing 
clinical decision rules for mild head injury patients to 
determine who really needs a CT scan.
Initial Management of Closed Head Injury in Adults, 2nd Edition  NSW HEALTH  PAGE 25",27,LEFT,398,Page 27 (LEFT)
chunk_27_RIGHT,"The risk from radiation can either be expressed as an 
estimated lifetime risk of fatal cancer or as an estimated 
equivalent dose of radiation which takes into account organ 
doses and their relative radiosensitivity.122, 123, 127, 128, 130 It 
is important to recognise that these risks are all estimates 
based on epidemiological studies of atomic bomb survivors 
extrapolated to current estimated doses of radiation 
delivered by CT scans. Perhaps the best way to put the risk 
of CT scanning into perspective is to compare the estimated 
risks with more common everyday risks.129 
Put into context the risk of radiation from an individual 
head CT scan is very low.122, 123, 127-130
- 
Estimated overall lifetime risk of fatal cancer (1 in 3)
- Estimated risk of clinically important lesion on CT in 
mild head injury (1 in 100)
- Estimated additional lifetime risk of fatal cancer from 
adult trauma panscan (1 in 1,000)
- Estimated additional lifetime risk of fatal cancer from 
single child CT head (1 in 5,000)

single adult CT head (1 in 10,000)
- Estimated additional lifetime risk of fatal cancer from 
trauma series x-rays (1 in 20,000)

single chest x-ray (1 in 1,000,000)
- Estimated equivalent dose of radiation from a chest 
x-ray (0.02 mSv per CXR)
- Estimated equivalent dose of radiation from adult CT 
head (2 mSv per scan) 
- Estimated equivalent dose of radiation from annual 
background radiation (2 mSv per year)
- Estimated equivalent dose of radiation from adult CT 
trauma panscan (20 mSv per scan)
- Annual safety limit for radiation exposure for radiation 
workers (.20 mSv per year)
- Estimated mean equivalent dose of radiation exposure 
for atomic bomb survivors linked to increased rates of 
fatal cancer (40 mSv dose)
It is important to recognise that the absolute risk to an 
individual is relatively small particularly with advancing 
age. More caution is recommended in children due to 
the concerns on cognitive development as well as lifetime 
risk of cancer. The lifetime risk of cancer for a young child 
receiving a CT head would be roughly double that of an 
adult (1 in 5000).",27,RIGHT,370,Page 27 (RIGHT)

- Single young child CT head increases lifetime risk of 
fatal cancer from 30% to 30.02%
- Single adult CT trauma panscan increases lifetime risk 
of fatal cancer from 30% to 30.1%
Timing of CT scanning
There is no direct evidence to confirm what the best time 
to perform CT scanning in relation to time of injury is. The 
primary role of early CT scanning in mild head injury is early 
recognition of extradural or subdural haematomas prior 
to clinical deterioration.69 Early neurosurgical intervention 
prior to clinical deterioration is associated with improved 
outcome. However, early CT scan may potentially miss other 
intracranial injuries such as delayed subdural haematomas 
or contusions which are slower to become evident.69 
Fortunately, most studies have shown that an initial normal 
CT scan allows safe discharge and that the few patients 
who deteriorate usually have good outcome.9, 53, 89, 130 
Therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that CT scans should 
be performed shortly after a decision is made that one is 
necessary.
Adjunctive CT scanning
Some mild head injury patients will require CT scanning for 
other reasons such as cervical spine clearance in the elderly. 
Clearly, in these circumstances, clinicians should have a 
lower threshold for performing head CT scans at the same 
time for ease of management.
Repeat CT scanning
There has been some debate in the literature about 
whether mild head injury patients who have initially 
abnormal CT scans and require admission for hospital 
observation should have a routine repeat CT scan.132-136 The 
evidence from most of these small studies suggests that 
PAGE 26  Initial Management of Closed Head Injury in Adults, 2nd Edition  NSW HEALTH",28,LEFT,358,Page 28 (LEFT)
chunk_28_RIGHT,"most mild head injury patients with minor abnormalities 
on CT scan do not require routine repeat CT scanning if 
they are clinically improving with a normal GCS and no 
neurological deficit unless they are anti-coagulated. 
The other question that is often asked is should elderly 
anti-coagulated patients with normal initial CT scans 
have routine repeat CT scans and if so when should they 
be performed and should the patient be admitted for 
observation. There is little evidence to guide management 
in these situations. The consensus appears to be that 
the older the patient, and the more the patient is anticoagulated (higher INR), the greater the risk of delayed 
bleeding. However, how to manage that risk remains 
unclear.
Summary
- CT scanning is the best investigation for the early 
identification of neurosurgically significant focal 
intracranial lesions following mild head injury.
- CT scanning should be used as an adjunct to clinical 
assessment.
- Where structured clinical assessment indicates the risk 
of significant intracranial lesion is low, the routine use 
of CT scanning is unlikely to be of benefit. 
- CT scanning does not accurately predict the risk of 
post concussion symptoms in mild head injury patients.
- Early CT scanning may theoretically not demonstrate 
some subdural haematomas and cerebral contusions 
but there is little evidence to suggest that this is 
clinically relevant in most patients. 
- There is little evidence to guide the management of 
anti-coagulated elderly mild head injury patients with 
initially normal CT scans who are potentially at risk 
of delayed bleeds, especially subdural haematomas. 
There is increased risk with increased age and degree 
of coagulopathy but how to manage that risk remains 
unclear.

If CT scanning is unavailable
“High risk” mild head injury patients should be closely observed and be considered for transfer to a 
hospital with neurosurgical and CT scan facilities when CT scan is unavailable.
A clear decision about the need for transfer for CT scanning for “high risk” patients should be made 
at the time of initial assessment or after a brief period of observation. A local senior clinician should be 
consulted and the patient discussed with the network neurosurgical service.
The clinical symptoms of patients with mild head injury typically improve within two to four hours post 
time of injury. Patients with persistently abnormal or worsening clinical symptoms are at “high risk” of 
intracranial injury. A clear decision about the need for transfer for CT scanning should be made no later 
than 4 hours post time of injury.

chunk_30_LEFT,"RECOMMENDATION
Strength of 
recommendation
Patients at “highest risk” of intracranial injury who should be discussed with the network neurosurgical 
service regarding urgent transfer for CT scanning include those with:
- Persistent GCS<15 at two hours post injury
- Focal neurological deﬁ cit
- Clinical suspicion of skull fracture
- Any deterioration in GCS
- Post traumatic seizure in ED 
- Known coagulopathy (particularly if age >65 or INR >4)
- Persistent vomiting or severe headache
- Persistent abnormal alertness, behaviour, cognition or PTA at 4 hours post injury.
If it is decided, after consultation with a network neurosurgical service, that a “high risk” patient does 
not require urgent transfer for CT scanning, then that patient should have close clinical observation 
in hospital for at least 24 hours and until clinically improving. If there are any signs of deterioration 
or no improvement, the network neurosurgical service should again be consulted. Rapid transfer to a 
neurosurgical centre in the event of deterioration must be available if this strategy is to be used.
If patients are transferred for CT scanning they should ideally be transferred to a hospital with 
neurosurgical facilities to avoid secondary transfer.
A skull x-ray may be useful to conﬁ rm the presence of a skull fracture that mandates an early CT scan 
due to the increased risk of deterioration.
‘Low risk’ mild head injury not requiring CT scan
The following features indicate patients with mild head injury (initial GCS 14-15) at low risk of

- No post traumatic seizure
- Nil or brief loss of consciousness (<5min).
- Nil or brief post traumatic amnesia (<30min)
- No severe headache.
- No large scalp haematoma
- Isolated head injury
- No dangerous mechanism
- No known neurosurgery / neurological impairment
- No delayed presentation or representation.
After a period of observation (until at least four hours post time of injury)

chunk_31_LEFT,"Mild head injury patients (initial GCS 14-15) require a CT 
scan if they are clinically assessed as being at significant risk 
of acute deterioration from an underlying intracranial injury. 
The WHO Taskforce on MTBI (Borg et al 2004101) concluded 
that on the basis of their meta-analysis that “there is 
strong evidence that clinical factors can predict CT scan 
abnormalities and the need for (neurosurgical) intervention 
in adults.” There have been many recent studies looking at 
which risk factors predict intracranial injury and the need 
for CT scan and a variety of clinical decision rules have 
been developed. These studies are mostly based on large 
prospectively collected data bases in the USA, Canada, and 
Europe although their findings have been reproduced in 
smaller studies throughout the world. Haydel et al32 (2000 
– New Orleans Criteria), Stiell et al35 (2001 – Canadian CT 
Head Rules), Mower et al58 (2005 – NEXUS II) and Smits 
et al47 (2007 – CHIP Rule) have all derived clinical decision 
rules with slightly varying inclusion and exclusion criteria 
and identified risk factors. Ibanez et al33 (2004), Fabbri et 
al125 (2004) and Stein et al48 (2009) have also done large 
studies looking at clinical risk factors and assessing the 
validity of the various clinical decision rules and guidelines 
while Rosengren et al118 (2004) and Fong et al57 (2008) have 
performed similar smaller studies on Australian populations. 
Ono et al137 (2007), Turedi et al81 (2008) and Saboori et 
al80 (2007) have published recent studies on Japanese, 
Turkish and Iranian populations. Kuppermam et al85 (2009) 
and Dunning et al138 (2006) have recently published large 
studies in the paediatric population in which they identified 
clinical risk factors and developed clinical decision rules 
that are similar to those developed for adults. There is now 
a large body of evidence suggesting that mild head injury 
patients can be risk stratified based on clinical assessment. 
The clinical risk factors that indicate patients are at 
increased risk of intracranial injury are discussed in the 
following text, and most of the relevant studies summarised 
in the evidentiary tables. 
Mild head injury patients can be risk stratified into “low” 
or “high” risk groups based on the presence or absence 
of identified clinical risk factors. The absence of clinical 
risk factors on initial assessment combined with a period 
of observation during which the patient clinically improves 
makes the probability of a significant intracranial injury 
extremely unlikely. These low risk mild head injury patients 
can be discharged for home observation without CT 
scanning. Among the patients with identified risk factors, 
there are those who clearly require CT scanning and those 
in whom clinical judgement may be required. In the high 
risk group, which includes initially low risk patients who 
Initial Management of Closed Head Injury in Adults, 2nd Edition  NSW HEALTH  PAGE 29",31,LEFT,464,Page 31 (LEFT)
chunk_31_RIGHT,"fail to clinically improve, both CT scanning and prolonged 
clinical observation are indicated. In the patients where 
clinical judgement is required this should be based on the 
clinician’s experience, the number of identified risk factors 
and clinical observation of the patient. 
Early CT scanning allows identification of acute extradural 
or subdural haematomas or depressed skull fractures 
requiring neurosurgical intervention and other structural 
lesions such as intracerebral haematomas or minor 
skull fractures that put the patient at increased risk of 
deterioration or complications such as post traumatic 
seizures, and disabling post concussive symptoms. However, 
it is important to recognise that the absence of a structural 
lesion on CT scan does not exclude the possibility of 
deterioration, post traumatic seizures or significant post 
concussion symptoms.
Patients with an abnormal CT scan should be discussed 
with a neurosurgical service and considered for prolonged 
observation in hospital. Conversely, a normal CT scan 
makes acute clinical deterioration highly unlikely and 
allows safe discharge for home observation as long as 
the patient is clinically improving and does not have a 
known coagulopathy. A normal CT scan is useful to rule 
out structural lesions but does not exclude the possibility 
of significant post concussion symptoms. It is important 
to stress that CT scanning should be used as a clinical tool 
in conjunction with clinical assessment and observation as 
part of an overall management strategy for mild head injury 
patterns.
Individual factors predicting risk of 
intracranial injury and therefore the need 
for CT scanning in patients with mild head 
injury:
Initial GCS
A persistent GCS <15 at two hours post injury 
is a strong indication for CT scanning. An initial 
GCS 14 on admission is a relative indication for CT 
scanning.31, 33, 35, 36, 47, 48, 50-53, 56, 58, 62, 70, 74, 139
Several studies have noted the heterogeneity of the original 
GCS 13-15 mild head injury classification and these findings 
are summarised in Appendix 1. Patients with an initial GCS 
13 have been shown to have similar rates of intracranial 
injury to those with initial GCS 9-12.53, 105 Recent studies 
on mild head injury that published data on patients with",31,RIGHT,353,Page 31 (RIGHT)
chunk_32_LEFT,"GCS 13 have confirmed that an initial GCS 13 has a much 
higher rate of intracranial injury.35, 47, 56 Many other recent 
studies have used the definition of mild head injury as GCS 
14 or 15 on arrival and excluded patients with an initial 
GCS 13. Although patients with an initial GCS 14-15 have 
lower rates of intracranial injury as a group, the more recent 
studies have confirmed a higher risk of intracranial injury 
for an initial GCS 14.31, 32, 35, 47, 48, 56, 58 A number of the 
recent, well designed studies have attempted to identify risk 
factors which can predict which patients with an initial GCS 
14-15 are at highest risk.31, 32, 35, 47, 48, 56, 58 This evidence 
confirms that other risk factors can be used to successfully 
stratify risk within the initial GCS 14-15 group.
One strategy is to relate the significance of the GCS to the 
time of injury. In most of the studies on GCS 14-15, the 
reported higher risk of intracranial injury for an initial GCS 
14 does not take into account the time of injury. Recent 
studies that have reported time of presentation (Fabbri et 
al,31 Smits et al54 and Styrke et al43) have shown that mild 
head injuries present around 60 to 90 minutes post injury. 
An abnormal initial GCS taken within one hour of injury is 
therefore likely to overestimate the risk of intracranial injury 
in mild head injury patients who present early. One of the 
most relevant findings to clinical practice is that of Stiell et 
al35 who showed that for patients presenting with an initial 
GCS 13-15 that GCS <15 at two hours post injury was a 
useful predictor of risk of intracranial injury. By applying this 
criteria, both time of injury and GCS are usefully combined 
in a clinically practical assessment tool. Using GCS <15 
at two hours post injury allows for clinical judgement 
regarding patients who present immediately following 
injury or with drug or alcohol ingestion, allows for lack 
of inter observer reliability and stresses the importance of 
relating persistently abnormal GCS to time of injury. It also 
emphasises the significance of a patient presenting with 
a GCS of less than 15 or other signs of abnormal mental 
status at more than two hours after injury. 
Focal neurological deficits
Focal neurological deficit is a strong indication for CT 
scanning.31-35, 47, 48, 53, 58, 62, 68-70, 139-141 
PAGE 30  Initial Management of Closed Head Injury in Adults, 2nd Edition  NSW HEALTH",32,LEFT,414,Page 32 (LEFT)
chunk_32_RIGHT,"All the major clinical decision rules use neurological deficit 
as an indication for CT scan or list it as an exclusion 
criteria. Focal neurological deficits have been shown to 
significantly increase the risk of intracranial injury.31, 34, 47-49, 
53, 58 Both Haydel et al32 and Stiell et al35, 56 excluded focal 
neurological deficits in their studies due to the previously 
proven nature of risk. Conversely, Vilke et al75 showed 
that a normal neurological examination does not rule out 
underlying brain injury in mild head injuries. 
Skull fractures
Clinical suspicion or evidence of skull fracture is a 
strong indication for CT scanning.32-35, 47-49, 56, 58, 62, 
66, 68, 70, 71, 74, 88, 140  
Clinical suspicion or evidence of skull fracture has been 
shown to be a significant risk factor for intracranial injury. 
The meta analyses by Hofman et al66 showed that the 
x-ray presence of skull fracture had a specificity of 95% 
for intracranial injury. Clinical suspicion or evidence of 
skull fracture has been shown by several authors including 
Stiell et al,35 Haydel et al32 and Palchek et al34 to be a 
major risk factor for the presence of intracranial injury. 
This has been supported in subsequent studies by Stiell et 
al,56 Mower et al,58 Smits et al47 and Stein et al.48 Clinical 
suspicion of open, depressed or base of skull fractures 
is based on the presence of large scalp lacerations or 
haematomas (especially in children <2 years), obvious skull 
depression, and base of skull signs such as raccoon eyes, 
haemotympanum, Battles sign, or CSF leak. Skull fracture 
should also be suspected on the basis of the mechanism of 
injury with a significant focal blunt force to the skull such 
as a bat, ball, bar, boot or club. The presence of significant 
facial fractures may also indicate the possibility of skull 
fracture.
Loss of consciousness
The absence of loss of consciousness does not rule 
out intracranial injury. Brief loss of consciousness (<5 
minutes) slightly increases risk of intracranial injury 
but should not be considered a routine indication 
for CT scan in the absence of other risk factors. 
Prolonged loss of consciousness (>5 minutes) should 
be considered a strong indication for CT scanning.1, 
6, 9, 31-34, 47, 54, 57-59, 61, 63, 65, 67, 72-74, 141",32,RIGHT,373,Page 32 (RIGHT)
chunk_33_LEFT,"Loss of consciousness increases the risk of intracranial injury 
and is used by many authorities to define mild head injury 
(Evidence Table 1). However, the absolute risk associated 
with loss of consciousness is small.6, 74
The absence of loss of consciousness or amnesia has been 
used to classify patients as ‘minimal risk’.6, 8-10 However, 
more recent studies have shown that the absence of loss of 
consciousness does not rule out intracranial lesions in either 
adults or children.9, 33, 34, 47, 54, 57-59, 65, 85 Similarly, adult 
studies have shown that transient LOC does not accurately 
predict the risk of intracranial injury.33, 61, 67, 73, 141, 142
Duration of loss of consciousness is also controversial. 
‘Brief’ loss of consciousness in mild head injury patients is 
usually associated with good functional outcome while a 
specific time for ‘prolonged’ loss of consciousness is not 
clearly associated with poorer outcome.10, 63, 72, 74 The 
exact definitions of what should be considered a low-risk 
duration vary greatly from momentary to five minutes, 
to 20 minutes to 30 minutes.6, 8-10 In the NEXUS II study, 
prolonged loss of consciousness > 5 minutes was found to 
increase risk of intracranial injury but was not a sufficiently 
useful discriminator to include in their clinical decision 
rule derivation.58 The clinical recommendation of the 
neurosurgical committee of the Royal Australasian College 
of Surgeons (RACS) is that loss of consciousness should be 
considered brief if less than five minutes.1
From a practical viewpoint, obtaining a definite history and 
duration of loss of consciousness is often difficult.47, 143 In a 
recent review, Ruff et al143 detailed the difficulties in getting 
a reliable history of loss of consciousness. Head injuries are 
frequently unwitnessed, observers unreliable and patients 
often affected by alcohol or post traumatic amnesia. It is 
perhaps simplest to consider loss of consciousness in terms 
of no loss of consciousness, brief loss of consciousness 
less than five minutes or prolonged loss of consciousness 
greater than five minutes. Most patients with a witnessed 
prolonged loss of consciousness are likely to have other 
indications for CT scan but in the unlikely event that none 
were present then a CT scan should be performed.
Post traumatic amnesia
Persistent post traumatic amnesia is a strong 
indication for CT scanning. Amnesia for the event 
does not warrant CT scanning.31, 32, 35, 47, 56, 74 
Initial Management of Closed Head Injury in Adults, 2nd Edition  NSW HEALTH  PAGE 31",33,LEFT,401,Page 33 (LEFT)
chunk_33_RIGHT,"Several studies have noted that prolonged anterograde 
or retrograde post traumatic amnesia are risk factors for 
intracranial injury and the recent study by Smits et al47 
identified persistent post traumatic amnesia (PTA) as a 
significant independent risk factor. Amnesia for the event 
implies transient neurological dysfunction and indicates 
mildly increased risk of intracranial injury although the 
absolute risk remains small.74 Anterograde amnesia (typically 
defined as the period of loss of short term memory for 
events following the head injury) and post traumatic 
amnesia (typically defined as the period of inability to lay 
down new memories following a head injury) are essentially 
a continuum. A prolonged duration of both anterograde 
amnesia and post traumatic amnesia have both been shown 
to be associated with risk of intracranial injury.32, 35, 47, 56 
Haydel et al32 identified short term memory deficit as a 
significant risk factor for intracranial injury. Stiell et al35 also 
identified anterograde amnesia of more than 30 minutes as 
a risk factor but did not include it in their clinical decision 
rule. Mower et al58 found that abnormal alertness, in which 
they included short term memory deficits and perseverating 
speech, was a significant risk factor for intracranial injury. 
Retrograde amnesia (defined as the period of loss of short 
term memory for events prior to the head injury) has been 
shown by Stiell et al35 to be of significance if greater than 
30 minutes duration. 
Post traumatic amnesia that persists for more than 24 
hours has been shown to be a significant risk factor for 
persistent cognitive-behavioural-social dysfunction and 
is a clinical indicator of moderate traumatic brain injury.3 
Recent Australian studies have looked at using specific 
bedside tools in the emergency department to better 
identify patients with persistent PTA so that these patients 
can be more closely followed up as they are more likely 
to suffer significant post concussion symptoms.3, 106-108 
From a practical point of view, all patients with mild head 
injury should be assessed for post traumatic amnesia. As 
Ruff et al143 pointed out, it may be difficult to establish an 
accurate assessment of the period of PTA due to the patient 
being told what happened by others, the influence of 
drugs or alcohol or psychological stress and the limitations 
of clinical assessment. It is useful to assess the patient’s 
recall of events following their injury by asking specific 
questions such as what is their first clear memory, who 
helped them at the scene and how they got to hospital. 
This can be used to estimate the period of post traumatic 
amnesia. Clinicians should also look for symptoms of post 
traumatic amnesia such as repetitive questioning, failure to 
remember clinical staff and inability to remember events",33,RIGHT,446,Page 33 (RIGHT)
chunk_34_LEFT,"during their hospital stay. A formal assessment tool like the 
A-WPTAS (see Appendix 4) or a simple memory assessment 
technique such as three object recall can be used as an 
objective bedside screening test for post traumatic amnesia, 
to supplement the ‘history’ of post traumatic amnesia 
for events. Patients who have evidence of prolonged 
post traumatic amnesia and particularly those who have 
persistent post traumatic amnesia at four hours post injury 
should be considered for CT scanning.
Post traumatic seizure
Post traumatic seizures have not been shown to be 
a major risk factor for intracranial injury but clinical 
considerations make them a strong indication for CT 
scanning.74, 133, 162
Post traumatic seizures are normally classified as immediate, 
early (<7days) or delayed (>7days).144 Brief generalised post 
traumatic seizures immediately following mild head injury 
are relatively common and are not usually associated with 
poor outcome. They are frequently seen on sporting fields 
and in young children. It has been proposed that these 
immediate seizures be called “concussive convulsions” 
and it has been suggested that they are not an epileptic 
phenomena.64, 107, 134 McCrory et al145 demonstrated 
that outcome was universally good for these “concussive 
convulsions” in elite Australian sportsmen. Prolonged 
or focal post traumatic seizures are more likely to be 
associated with significant intracranial injury. Some patients 
who have seizures associated with trauma may have preexisting epilepsy which may either have caused the seizure 
or resulted in a lower seizure threshold.146 However, most 
mild head injury studies do not differentiate between types 
of seizures when assessing risk factors for intracranial 
injury.74, 132 The literature is somewhat contradictory about 
the risk of seizures being associated with intracranial injury. 
Many of the larger studies found that post traumatic 
seizures were not significantly associated with intracranial 
injury.85, 115, 168, 172, 174 Haydel et al,32 however, found that 
they were significant and Smits et al47 found that they 
were not statistically significant but included them in their 
decision rule because of their perceived clinical importance. 
Neidlinger et al146 found that the “yield of unsuspected 
major intracranial abnormality on CT scan justifies a policy 
of its routine use in trauma patients with seizure or who are 
post ictal, regardless of prior seizure history.” 
From a practical viewpoint, any patient who has a definite 
PAGE 32  Initial Management of Closed Head Injury in Adults, 2nd Edition  NSW HEALTH",34,LEFT,390,Page 34 (LEFT)
chunk_34_RIGHT,"pre or post traumatic seizure witnessed by a reliable 
observer probably warrants a CT scan to exclude significant 
underlying pathology even though the yield is likely to be 
low. A patient who has an early post traumatic seizure 
while in the emergency department would be considered 
to have deteriorated and would warrant a CT scan. Patients 
who have early post traumatic seizures with structural 
lesions on CT scan are at increased risk of further seizures 
and developing post traumatic epilepsy and need to be 
considered for prophylactic anti-convulsants and given 
appropriate lifestyle advice. 
Vomiting
Persistent or recurrent vomiting is a strong indication 
for CT scanning. Any vomiting is a relative indication 
for CT scanning.38, 49, 53, 60, 74, 85, 94, 97, 108, 109, 115, 131, 
133, 150, 162, 168, 172, 174, 184 
Vomiting has been identified as a significant risk factor for 
intracranial injury in many studies.38, 49, 60, 74, 94, 97, 108, 115, 
133, 162, 168, 172, 174 There has been some debate whether 
persistent vomiting is more relevant than isolated vomiting. 
Stiell et al35 identified repeated vomiting (more than one 
occasion) as being a significant risk factor for intracranial 
injury. All the major adult clinical decision rules have either 
vomiting or recurrent vomiting as a major risk factor for 
intracranial injury. In the paediatric literature recurrent 
vomiting is also considered a significant risk factor although 
it is noted that isolated vomiting is more common in 
younger children. Clement et al77 identified any vomiting 
as a significant risk factor for neurosurgical intervention in 
patients with initial GCS 15.
Headache
Persistent severe headache is a strong indication for 
CT scanning.38, 53, 74, 85, 97, 108, 109, 115, 133, 168
The literature is somewhat contradictory about the 
significance of headache. Mild headache is a common 
symptom of mild head injury but severe headache appears 
to be a significant risk factor for intracranial injury. Many 
studies have identified either headache or more commonly 
severe headache as a significant risk factor for intracranial 
injury.38, 74, 85, 97, 108, 133, 168 However, Stiell et al35 and 
Smits et al47 both found that headache was not a good 
discriminator compared to other risk factors and did not",34,RIGHT,362,Page 34 (RIGHT)
chunk_35_LEFT,"include it in their clinical decision rules. Mower et al58 
found that severe headache was a risk factor but did not 
include it in their clinical decision rule. Interestingly, in a 
later study, Clement et al77 found that severe headache was 
a significant risk factor for those patients with GCS 15 who 
required neurosurgical intervention. 
The general trend of the literature would suggest that mild 
headache is not a significant concern but persistent severe 
headache should be considered a significant risk factor for 
intracranial injury.
Coagulopathy or bleeding disorder
Known coagulopathy or bleeding disorder is both 
a strong indication for early CT scan and also an 
indication to check the INR and to consider reversal 
of anticoagulation. Anticoagulated patients with any 
evidence of haemorrhage on CT scan should have 
early rapid reversal of anticoagulation. Patients with 
a supra-therapeutic INR (>4) should be considered 
for either partial or full reversal and admitted to 
hospital for prolonged observation. Prolonged 
observation and follow up repeat CT scan should 
be considered for any anticoagulated patients or 
patients with bleeding disorders.39, 42, 53, 54, 63, 74, 
85-87, 110, 115, 153, 162, 172, 174, 187
Most guidelines and studies on mild head injury mention 
coagulopathy or bleeding disorder either as a significant 
risk factor or an exclusion criteria in the assessment of 
risk of intracranial injury.42, 53, 74, 85, 87, 115, 153, 162, 172, 
174, 187 However, there was no compelling evidence to 
either support or refute this reasonable assertion in 
the mild head injury patient group until recently. Mina 
et al147 demonstrated that pre-existing anticoagulation 
significantly increased the risk of death from intracranial 
injury in trauma patients with head injury. However, this 
was a heterogenous patient group with significantly 
abnormal ISS (mean 17.0 +/- 7.8) and GCS (mean 11.8 
+/- 4.0). Subsequent small studies by Franko et al,78 Ivascu 
et al,79 Cohen et al,148 Fabbri et al41 and Allard et al149 
have all demonstrated significant risk of both intracranial 
haemorrhage and mortality in anti-coagulated head injury 
patients. Cohen et al148 and Ivascu et al79 both found that 
patients with mild head injury were at significant risk of 
intracranial injury and acute deterioration particularly if 
they had an increased INR. An initial normal CT scan did 
not exclude the possibility of deterioration. Franko et al78 
Initial Management of Closed Head Injury in Adults, 2nd Edition  NSW HEALTH  PAGE 33",35,LEFT,393,Page 35 (LEFT)
chunk_35_RIGHT,"also demonstrated a link between increased mortality 
and increased INR (>4). Ivascu et al79 demonstrated that 
early rapid reversal of warfarin in patients with intracranial 
haemorrhage significantly improved mortality. 
Mild head injury patients who are warfarinised are at 
significantly increased risk of traumatic intracranial 
haemorrhage particularly if they are elderly or overwarfarinised. Note that this increased risk applies to 
asymptomatic patients. They should all receive an urgent CT 
scan and have an early INR checked. Patients who have a 
traumatic injury on CT scan or who have a supratherapeutic 
INR (>4) should be admitted for observation and should 
be strongly considered for short term reversal of their anticoagulation as they are at high risk of acute deterioration 
and death. A routine repeat CT scan within 24 hours or an 
urgent repeat CT scan if there are any signs of deterioration 
is recommended for these patients. Clinical judgement is 
required about the disposition of patients with an initial 
normal CT scan and normal INR. Prolonged observation 
and close follow up either in hospital or in the community 
is reasonable until further evidence is available to guide 
management.
The evidence is less clear about the risk of traumatic ICH 
associated with anti-platelet agents or bleeding disorders. 
There are very few studies specifically addressing the issue 
and those that have been done provide contradictory 
findings.9, 89, 129, 164 There is a clear trend to suggest 
patients on anti-platelets have an increased risk of bleeding 
following intracranial haemorrhage but limited evidence 
to prove that anti-platelets independently increase the risk 
of intracranial haemorrhage for mild head injury patients. 
Extrapolating from existing anti-coagulation protocols, 
population studies on stroke and other studies on mild head 
injury, it would be reasonable to postulate that increasing 
age and the presence of more than one anti-platelet agent 
would increase the risk of bleeding. Since most patients 
on anti-platelet agents are elderly and elderly patients are 
recommended to have routine CT scans, the remaining 
clinical dilemma is what is the risk of delayed bleeding. At 
present this remains unknown and prolonged observation 
and close follow up in the community is probably prudent. 
Age
Patient age >65 years is a strong indication for CT 
scanning.20, 38, 47, 53, 60, 74, 85, 88, 115, 153, 162, 172, 174",35,RIGHT,375,Page 35 (RIGHT)
chunk_36_LEFT,"The literature has shown that there is an increased risk of 
intracranial injury for patients aged over 60-65 years with 
mild head injury.20, 38, 47, 53, 60, 74, 85, 88, 101, 115, 162, 172, 174 All 
the recently published clinical decision rules have included 
age over 60 or 65 years as a major risk factor. Mack et al150 
recommended routine head CT for elderly patients suffering 
mild head injury as they could not identify any useful clinical 
predictors of intracranial injury in the elderly. Similarly, 
Rathlev et al151 analysed the elderly patients from the 
NEXUS II trial and found that there was an increased risk of 
intracranial risk with age and that occult presentation was 
more common. The Brain Trauma Foundation15 concluded 
that ‘increasing age is a strong independent factor in 
prognosis, with significant increase in poor outcome above 
60 years of age’ for patients with severe head injuries. 
Similarly, Williams et al76 demonstrated that elderly patients 
were more likely to sustain complications of mild head 
injury. Servadei et al6 have pointed out it is unlikely there is 
a specific age at which risk of intracranial injury dramatically 
increases. Fabbri et al31 found that using age >60 years 
alone to predict the need for CT scanning in patients with 
mild head injury was impractical from a cost-resource 
consideration during a study to validate a set of guidelines. 
Interestingly, of the 705 patients meeting guidelines criteria 
for CT scanning based on age >60 years alone who did not 
have CT scans, Fabbri et al31 found that only one patient 
deteriorated within 48 hours. It is worth noting that the 
NSW Institute of Trauma and Injury Management Trauma 
Death Review Committee has identified that in 2003 / 
2004 elderly NSW patients with head injuries represented a 
significant number of potentially preventable deaths.152 
Patients aged >65 with a mild head injury should have a 
CT scan due to the increased risk of intracranial injury. If CT 
scan is not available and the patient has no other identified 
risk factors then the absolute risk is probably small and 
clinical judgement can be used to justify prolonged 
observation rather than transfer for CT scan. Prolonged 
observation in hospital or at home should be considered 
even if an initial CT scan is normal due to the increased risk 
of delayed complications.
Abnormal alertness, behaviour or cognition
Persistent abnormal mental status manifested by 
abnormal alertness, abnormal behaviour or cognitive 
impairment is a strong indication for CT scanning.38, 
49, 55, 58, 74, 94, 97, 103, 115, 133, 174
Persistent abnormal mental status manifested by abnormal 
PAGE 34  Initial Management of Closed Head Injury in Adults, 2nd Edition  NSW HEALTH",36,LEFT,441,Page 36 (LEFT)
chunk_36_RIGHT,"alertness, abnormal behaviour or cognitive impairment 
has been shown to be strongly associated with intracranial 
injury.38, 74, 115, 174 Mower et al58 used abnormal alertness 
or behaviour as major criteria in their clinical decision rule 
and Clement et al77 found confusion, restlessness and 
abnormal 3 object recall as significant risks. Similarly, in 
the paediatric literature, abnormal mental status has been 
identified as a major risk factor.49, 74, 94 Although initial 
GCS partially assesses mental status, it primarily addresses 
level of consciousness. Clinical observation of alertness, 
behaviour and cognition will detect more subtle changes 
in mental status than GCS and should be part of routine 
neurological observation. Persistent abnormal PTA testing is 
also an indication of abnormal mental status. Detection of 
abnormal alertness or behaviour and cognitive impairment 
requires careful observation by staff and relatives and 
is particularly important for adults with pre-existing 
neurological impairment. In patients with pre-existing 
neurological conditions, a lower threshold for CT scanning 
is appropriate.6, 33 
Most studies do not identify at what time post injury that 
abnormal mental status becomes a definite indication 
for CT scanning. Extrapolating from the GCS <15 at two 
hours post injury risk factor, it would be reasonable to 
identify abnormal mental status as a risk factor at two 
hours post injury and certainly by four hours post injury. 
Clinical judgement is required depending on the degree of 
abnormality as to when to order a CT scan.
Large scalp haematoma or laceration
Large scalp haematomas or lacerations are relative 
indications for CT scanning in adults. Large non 
frontal scalp lacerations have been identified as 
significant risk factors in young children.14, 49, 74, 94, 
115, 123, 130, 162, 174 
The literature is somewhat unclear about the importance 
of scalp haematomas and lacerations as clinical risk factors. 
Haydel et al32 identified “visible trauma above the clavicles” 
as a major risk factor. Mower et al58 identified scalp 
haematoma as a major risk factor and included it in their 
clinical decision rule. Smits et al47 included “contusion to 
the skull” as a minor risk factor in their CHIP rule. In the 
other major adult clinical decision rules and studies, scalp 
haematoma was not identified as a major risk factor but 
was potentially implied under the broad term “suspected 
skull fracture.” In the paediatric literature, non frontal",36,RIGHT,380,Page 36 (RIGHT)
chunk_37_LEFT,"scalp haematoma is included in most clinical decision rules 
particularly among young children.14, 49, 94, 123, 130, 174 There 
is no clear guidance in the literature as to what should be 
considered a significant scalp haematoma or laceration 
other than a trend to “large’ and “non frontal”. There is 
no evidence for the use of descriptors such as “boggy” or 
“tense” to help discriminate between significant and non 
significant haematomas.
Drug or alcohol intoxication
Drug or alcohol ingestion with a normal mental state 
is not an indication for CT scanning. Drug or alcohol 
intoxication resulting in an abnormal mental state is 
an indication for CT scanning.22, 38, 40, 53, 74, 85, 115, 162, 
168, 172, 174 
Drug or alcohol intoxication is frequently present in patients 
with head injury and makes patients difficult to assess and 
manage. Cook et al,60 in a study of alcohol intoxicated 
patients, found that clinical examination could not predict 
which alcohol intoxicated patients had abnormal CT scans. 
However, they observed that the rate of abnormal CT scan 
and neurosurgical intervention was similar to that of the 
non-intoxicated mild head injury population. Several studies 
have suggested that drug or alcohol intoxication is a risk 
factor for intracranial injury but the exact definition of 
intoxication remains vague.31, 32
Since 2004 there have been several large well designed 
studies and clinical decision rules published that have found 
that alcohol is not an independent risk factor for intracranial 
injury in patients with mild head injury.22, 38, 85, 115, 162, 168, 
172 Bracken et al153 looked at the intoxicated patients (3356 
patients) in the NEXUS II database who had received CT 
scans and found that the rate of intracranial injury was 
lower than the non-intoxicated group. Although it would 
appear that alcohol intoxication is not an independent 
risk factor for intracranial injury it remains a common 
clinical dilemma to decide what to do with a head injured 
patient with an abnormal mental status when it is not clear 
whether it is the alcohol or the head injury that is causing 
the abnormality.
Stiell et al35 took a slightly different approach and used GCS 
<15 at two hours post injury as their variable to predict 
abnormal mental status for whatever reason. They argued 
that drug or alcohol intoxication was not an independent 
predictor of intracranial injury if the patient had a normal 
Initial Management of Closed Head Injury in Adults, 2nd Edition  NSW HEALTH  PAGE 35",37,LEFT,404,Page 37 (LEFT)
chunk_37_RIGHT,"mental status at two hours post injury.
From a practical viewpoint, clinically obvious drug or alcohol 
intoxication should be treated as a risk factor for intracranial 
injury because it manifests as abnormal mental status which 
impairs clinical assessment and must be assumed to be 
due to intracranial injury. It seems reasonable to use the 
approach of Stiell et al35 in determining when to order a CT 
scan in the absence of other risk factors.
Dangerous mechanisms of injury
Specifically identified high risk dangerous 
mechanisms that are a strong indication for CT 
scanning include pedestrian/cyclist struck by vehicle, 
ejection from vehicle, falls (>1m) and focal blunt 
trauma to the head (bat, ball, foot). In the absence 
of these specified risk factors or other risk factors, 
dangerous mechanism is a relative indication for CT 
scan in mild head injury patients. Clinical judgment is 
required.20, 38, 60, 72, 88, 115, 162, 172, 174
Epidemiological studies have generally identified motor 
vehicle accidents, falls and assaults as the commonest 
causes of head injuries. In studies on patients with mild 
head injuries, specific high risk factors for intracranial injury 
that have been identified include focal blunt trauma to the 
head,38, 60, 72, 88, 115 pedestrians or cyclists struck by motor 
vehicles,20, 60, 88, 172, 174 ejection from motor vehicle,172, 174 
and falls with variable heights specified.38, 172, 174
Multi-system trauma
In mild head injury patients with multi-system 
trauma, clinical judgement is required regarding the 
need for CT scanning, particularly in the presence of 
unstable vital signs or associated injuries requiring 
significant amounts of analgesia, procedural sedation 
or general anaesthesia.162, 172, 174 
Most guidelines and studies on mild head injury have 
specifically excluded patients with multi-system trauma 
or unstable vital signs.162, 172, 174 It is therefore difficult 
to make evidence based recommendations and clinical 
judgment is required. A low threshold for performing head 
CT scan in multi-system trauma patients should be used as 
subtle neurological signs are easily missed in the presence 
of distracting injuries. Similarly, clinicians should have a",37,RIGHT,333,Page 37 (RIGHT)
chunk_38_LEFT,"low threshold for performing CT scans where associated 
injuries require significant amounts of analgesia, procedural 
sedation or general anaesthesia. 
Pre-existing neurosurgery/neurological 
impairment
Pre-existing neurosurgery or neurological impairment 
is a relative indication for CT scanning.85, 153, 168 
Pre-existing neurosurgery has been suggested as an 
indication for CT scanning particularly in the presence 
of hydrocephalus and shunt placement.6, 33 Sevadei et 
al6 recommended routine CT scanning for patients with 
either previous neurosurgery or epilepsy. From a practical 
viewpoint, any pre-existing medical condition resulting 
in neurological impairment (eg stroke, dementia, and 
developmental delay) may make clinical assessment difficult. 
More recent studies have been unable to enrol sufficient 
numbers of patients to give clear guidance about these risk 
factors.48 
Delayed presentation or representation
Delayed presentation or representation are relative 
indications for CT scanning. Clinical judgement is 
required. Patients who present more than four hours 
post injury with persistent or new clinical symptoms 
should be regarded as being at relatively high risk for 
intracranial injury.4, 6, 44, 53, 114, 119 
Although mild head injuries are very common it is thought 
that the majority do not present to hospital.114, 119 
Therefore, those that do present to hospital are already a 
group at slightly increased risk. Of particular concern are 
those who have a delayed presentation due to persistence 
of symptoms or those who represent because of ongoing 
or new symptoms. Most of the larger studies have excluded 
patients who presented more than 24 hours post injury 
or who represented, so there is a lack of evidence about 
these patients. However, it is clear from most of the 
studies that patient’s who have persistent or new abnormal 
mental status, or persistent or new clinical symptoms such 
as vomiting or severe headache, have increased risk of 
intracranial injury. 
Delayed presentation due to ongoing symptoms should be 
regarded as being the same as failing to return to normal 
after clinical observation. Representation due to persistent 
PAGE 36  Initial Management of Closed Head Injury in Adults, 2nd Edition  NSW HEALTH",38,LEFT,330,Page 38 (LEFT)
chunk_38_RIGHT,"or worsening symptoms should be regarded as the same as 
clinical deterioration during clinical observation. Therefore, 
both patients who have a delayed presentation or who 
represent with new or worsening symptoms should be 
regarded as being at relatively high risk of intracranial injury. 
However, the overall risk of intracranial injury in patients 
who represent after mild head injuries is low if their initial 
risk was low and particularly if they had an initial normal CT 
scan.4, 6, 44, 53 
Unwitnessed event/unreliable history
A good history of injury may help predict risk of intracranial 
injury by identifying dangerous mechanism of injury or 
significant features such as prolonged loss of consciousness 
or seizures. This is of particular importance in children. 
However, in the absence of other significant risk factors 
there are few studies identifying unwitnessed event or 
unreliable history as a significant independent risk factor.140 
Paediatrics
Although paediatrics were excluded from the search 
strategy, the author believes that the evidence in the 
paediatric literature discussed below may assist clinicians 
in their decision making in the management of adults with 
closed head injury. The evidence was not identified in an 
exhaustive systematic literature search but represents the 
most relevant studies identified by the author.
In the past few years there have been several large studies 
looking at paediatric head injuries that have attempted to 
identify clinical risk factors indicating the need for CT scan 
and use these risk factors to develop clinical decision rules. 
Clinical decision rules have been developed for children by 
Palchak et al34 (2003), Haydel et al65 (2003 – New Orleans 
group), Oman et al87 (2006 – NEXUS group), Dunning 
et al138 (2006 – CHALICE group), Atakabi et al83 (2008 - 
Canadian CT Head group) and most recently Kupperman 
et al85 (2009 – PECARN group). Maguire et al86 published 
a systematic view of paediatric clinical prediction rules 
in 2009 that assessed all the major studies except the 
Kupperman study. The studies by Dunning et al enrolled 
22,772 patients and Kupperman et al enrolled 42,412 
patients and these are the two largest well designed studies 
yet performed on either adult or paediatric patients with 
head injuries.
The best predictors of the need for CT scan were similar 
in all the studies and similar to the findings of the adult 
literature. The best predictors present in nearly all prediction",38,RIGHT,387,Page 38 (RIGHT)
chunk_39_LEFT,"rules were abnormal mental status or behaviour (including 
GCS <15 or qualitative assessment), focal neurological 
deficit, clinically suspected skull fracture (non frontal scalp 
haematoma), vomiting and dangerous mechanism. Loss of 
consciousness was significant if “definite” in some and if 
“prolonged” in others. Severe headache and seizures were 
identified as significant in several. 
Kupperman et al85 took the clinically practical step of 
identifying those risk factors which strongly suggested 
the need for CT scan and differentiating them from those 
that required clinical judgement to decide whether to 
observe the child or proceed to CT scan. They made the 
practical point that where clinical judgement was used it 
should be based on experience, number of risk factors and 
a period of observation. In their summary of their clinical 
decision rule, they included their figures on the percentage 
of the population likely to be in each group, and the risk 
of clinically important brain injury in each group. This 
information could be used to help clinicians and parents to 
decide how to proceed for an individual child. 
In summary, the indications for CT scan and the clinical 
prediction rules in the paediatric literature are similar to 
those in the adult literature. There have been large well 
designed studies that support the use of structured clinical 
assessment to identify which patients should have a CT 
scan. Refer to NSW Health Infants & Children: Acute 
Management of Head Injury, second edition (PD2011_024) 
for management of head injury children.
What should be done with high risk 
mild head injury patients when CT 
scan is unavailable?
In patients with high risk mild head injury, a normal CT scan 
combined with clinical assessment will allow the patient to 
be safely discharged for home observation. If CT scan is 
unavailable then the patient will require either admission 
for prolonged observation or early transfer for CT scanning 
depending on clinical assessment of risk. Prolonged clinical 
observation for at least 24 hours, associated with clinical 
improvement, has been shown to make a significant injury 
unlikely in the majority of mild head injury patients.91 
However, those patients at highest risk for an intracranial 
injury identified by persistently abnormal GCS or clinical 
symptoms, deterioration in GCS, focal neurological deficit, 
or significant clinical suspicion of skull fracture should be 
transferred for CT scan to allow the early identification of 
potentially neurosurgically significant injury.
Initial Management of Closed Head Injury in Adults, 2nd Edition  NSW HEALTH  PAGE 37",39,LEFT,403,Page 39 (LEFT)
chunk_39_RIGHT,"It is reasonable to admit some mild head injury patients to 
hospital for serial observation if CT scan is unavailable and 
urgent transfer to neurosurgical care impractical. Prior to 
the widespread availability of CT scanning, admission for 
serial assessment of GCS was the standard treatment for 
patients with head injury. Borg et al101 (2004 diagnostic 
procedures), in a meta analysis for the World Health 
Organisation on mild traumatic brain injury, concluded that 
in the absence of CT scanning, that hospital observation for 
at least 24 hours for patients with GCS 15 and other risk 
factors was a reasonable strategy. Similarly, af Geijerstam et 
al91 found in a large population based study on mild head 
injury patients with GCS 15 that the outcome for a serial 
observation in hospital strategy was similar to the outcome 
for an immediate CT strategy at 3 month follow up. This 
presumed that appropriate care could be delivered in the 
event of deterioration. Clinical judgement is clearly required 
where patients have GCS 15 but clinical symptoms that 
fail to improve with observation. The primary advantage 
of performing an early CT scan is to be able to safely 
discharge a patient if the CT scan is normal. Thus, when 
CT is unavailable, serial clinical observation is a reasonable 
strategy for mild head injury patients with GCS 15 as long 
as patients can be transferred to neurosurgical care in a 
timely fashion in case of deterioration.",39,RIGHT,238,Page 39 (RIGHT)

What should be done when patients with mild head injury deteriorate?
RECOMMENDATION
Strength of 
recommendation
Early signs of deterioration:
- Confusion
- Agitation
- Drowsiness
- Vomiting
- Severe headache
Late signs of deterioration:
- Decrease in GCS by two or more points
- Dilated pupil
- Focal neurological deﬁ cit
- Seizure
- Cushing’s response – bradycardia and hypertension
Clinical approach to neurological deterioration:
- Resuscitation and stabilisation of ABCDEs to exclude non head injury cause 
- Supportive care of ABCDEs
- Early intubation if indicated
- Immediate CT scan if available
- Early neurosurgical consult
- Early retrieval consult 
- If clinical or CT evidence of raised ICP/mass effect consider in consultation with network 
neurosurgical service:

- short term hyperventilation to PaCO2 30-35
  
- bolus of mannitol (1g/kg)
  
- surgical decompression if more than 2 hours from neurosurgical care
  
- prophylactic anti-convulsants
Acute neurological deterioration is uncommon in patients 
with mild head injury. As discussed in Question 3, the 
recent literature would suggest that acute neurosurgical 
intervention is required in 1-3% of patients with mild 
head injury. Patients at highest risk of deterioration can 
be identified using clinical risk factors and should have a 
CT scan. It is very uncommon for patients to deteriorate if 
they have had a normal CT scan. The exception would be 
elderly patients who are anticoagulated who are at risk of 
delayed subdural haemorrhage. The other situation in which 
unexpected deterioration may occur is when an injury 
present on CT scan has been missed.
The clinical signs vary from early subtle signs of 
deterioration to more obvious late signs including reduction 
in GCS or signs of raised intracranial pressure. Clement et 
al77 looked at those patients in the Canadian CT Head Rules 
database with initial GCS 15 who deteriorated and required 
neurosurgery to try to identify risk factors for deterioration. 
They found that the development of confusion, agitation, 
PAGE 38  Initial Management of Closed Head Injury in Adults, 2nd Edition  NSW HEALTH",40,LEFT,334,Page 40 (LEFT)
chunk_40_RIGHT,"drowsiness, vomiting or severe headache were potential 
early signs of deterioration in this group.
Once a mild head injury patient deteriorates then the 
priorities are exclusion of other injuries, supportive care of 
the ABCDEs and early CT scan to identify a neurosurgically 
significant lesion. If a neurosurgically significant lesion 
is identified, further management should be discussed 
with a neurosurgical service including measures to reduce 
intracranial pressure and prevent seizures.
There is good evidence to support the systematic 
resuscitation of ABCDEs with prevention of hypoxia and 
hypotension and the early identification and decompression 
of acute neurosurgical lesions.25,103 There is some evidence 
to support short-term hyperventilation and mannitol while 
awaiting definitive surgery.2, 23, 102, 144, 188 There is some 
evidence to support the prophylactic use of anticonvulsants

chunk_42_LEFT,"Discharge criteria
Mild head injury patients can be discharged for home 
observation after initial period of in-hospital observation if 
they meet clinical, social and discharge advice criteria.4, 6, 
15, 44, 47, 49, 52, 56, 60, 65, 74, 81, 87, 94, 97, 99, 115, 118, 154, 158, 169, 170, 
174, 178, 181, 184, 191 Mild head injury patients can be safely 
discharged from hospital for home observation when the 
risk of acute deterioration from an underlying intracranial 
injury is assessed as being low. Safe discharge also 
requires that the patient has adequate social supports and 
appropriate advice on when to return to hospital.
The duration of in-hospital observation required will 
be determined by clinical assessment combined with 
selective use of imaging. Deterioration following mild head 
injury may occur due to missed or delayed intracranial 
haematomas or other complications such as SIADH, post 
traumatic seizures or severe post concussive symptoms. 
Although clinical assessment and observation combined 
with appropriate imaging will identify most at risk patients, 
the risk of deterioration is never zero. Although uncommon, 
deterioration may occur even after prolonged periods of 
observation and / or following normal CT scanning. The 
challenge of managing mild head injuries is to identify what 
is reasonable risk and to ensure that the patient is aware of 
the potential for delayed deterioration.
All the recent clinical decision rules have shown that safe 
discharge is possible after clinical assessment and/or CT scan. 
In both a series of meta analyses and a large population 
study, af Geijerstam et al3, 4, 6 have shown that the risk 
of deterioration following mild head injury is low and the 
risk of deterioration following normal CT scans is very low. 
De Broussard et al92 also found that the risk of delayed 
intracranial complications following mild head injury were 
very low in a large population study. 
The Initial Management of Adult Mild Head Injury algorithm 
summaries the key points in management relating to safe 
discharge and some of the significant studies relating to 
safe discharge are presented in Evidence Table 6. Mild 
head injury patients should essentially be divided into 
low and high risk groups based on clinical assessment. 
Low risk mild head injury patients can be discharged for 
home observation after a short period of observation in 
hospital if clinically improving. High risk patients require CT 
scanning and/or prolonged observation. High risk patients 
with clinically important abnormalities on CT scan require 
admission for prolonged observation. High risk patients 
PAGE 40  Initial Management of Closed Head Injury in Adults, 2nd Edition  NSW HEALTH",42,LEFT,420,Page 42 (LEFT)
chunk_42_RIGHT,"with normal CT scanning should also be admitted for 
prolonged observation unless rapid clinical improvement 
occurs. In both high and low risk mild head injury 
patients, potential clinical indications for admission such 
as intercurrent medical problems and injuries need to be 
considered. Whatever the period of observation selected, 
the provision of safe discharge advice and assessment 
of the patient’s social situation is mandatory because 
occasional cases of deterioration following discharge are 
unavoidable. An example of a suitable head injury discharge 
advice sheet is attached at Appendix 6.
Discharge advice
All patients with mild head injury should be given both 
verbal and written discharge advice covering signs and 
symptoms of acute deterioration, when to seek urgent 
medical attention, lifestyle advice to assist recovery, 
information about typical post concussion symptoms and 
reasons for seeking further medical follow up. As with all 
discharge advice this should be time specific and action 
specific. 
There have been multiple studies that have shown that the 
risk of acute deterioration following mild head injury is very 
small particularly if the patient has been assessed as being 
low risk clinically or has been assessed as high risk and has 
had a normal CT scan. However, all the authors of major 
guidelines and clinical prediction rules consistently stress the 
point that there is a very small risk of deterioration for an 
individual patient, not to mention the possibility of medical 
error, which is why all patients should be advised about 
symptoms and signs of deterioration and when to seek 
urgent medical attention.
The most important complications of mild head injury 
to identify are those requiring acute neurosurgical 
intervention. However, functional deficits resulting in 
cognitive-behavioural-social sequelae are far more common 
and may have significant impact on patients and their 
families. It is important that doctors, patients and their 
families understand that the absence of a structural lesion 
on CT scan following a mild head injury does not exclude 
the possibility of significant cognitive-behavioural-social 
sequelae. Mild head injury discharge advice should include 
information about post concussion symptoms including 
what they are, how to minimise them and when to seek 
further medical attention if they persist. It is very important 
that patients are informed about the potential that they 
will have post concussion symptoms so that they are able",42,RIGHT,377,Page 42 (RIGHT)
chunk_43_LEFT,"to adjust their lifestyle if required. The best advice to give a 
patient who suffers from post concussion symptoms is that 
the symptoms will resolve with time and that they should 
take a stepwise graded return to sport, work and study. The 
sports medicine approach to concussion of graded return 
to play translates well to all mild head injury patients.153 
However, there has been a tendency in the past not to 
mention post concussion symptoms in discharge advice 
which may lead to unnecessary distress and confusion 
for patients and their relatives and hinder their recovery. 
As Jagoda et al9 for the American College of Emergency 
Physicians pointed out, “a glaring omission from most mild 
TBI discharge instructions is the lack of any mention of 
the possibility of the patient developing post-concussive 
symptoms.” Holm et al102 for the WHO Collaborating 
Taskforce on Mild Traumatic Brain Injury concluded that the 
only interventions that have been shown to be beneficial 
for post concussion symptoms are education, reassurance 
and time. Therefore, it is important to provide education 
about post concussion symptoms to all mild head injury 
patients. All patients should be given written advice and 
advised to see a doctor if they are not feeling better within 
a few days of injury.
Both Fung et al155 and Bazarian et al82 found that most 
head injury discharge advice sheets in a selection of US 
emergency departments were either not routinely provided 
or were difficult to understand or did not include sufficient 
information. Similarly, Yates et al156 in a New Zealand 
study found that a head injury discharge sheet was better 
understood when written in a simplified form using less 
complex language. 
The mild head injury advice sheet developed for the 
original version of these guidelines included most of the 
relevant information suggested by the literature and was 
well received during the implementation trials and after 
publication. It has since been further modified by the 
Motor Accidents Authority (MAA) NSW103 after community 
trials to simplify the language and format in line with the 
recommendations of Fung et al.155 This updated mild head 
injury discharge advice sheet is included in this guideline 
and is available in several languages through the MAA 
website.
All patients with mild head injury should be advised to 
follow up with their local doctor if they are not feeling

It is important that patients with mild head injury are 
able to access appropriate follow up from their local

Moderate head injury 
Standard care:
- Initial systematic assessment and resuscitation of ABCDEs
- Supportive care of ABCDEs with appropriate attention to positioning (30° head up), basic nursing 
care and avoidance of hyperventilation or hypoventilation.
- Prevention of secondary brain injury by avoiding hypoxaemia (O2 saturation <90%) and hypotension 
(systolic BP <90)
- Early CT scan to identify acute neurosurgical lesions 
- Period of clinical observation
- Consider intubation in the event of clinical deterioration to facilitate resuscitation of ABCDEs or to 
facilitate management of agitated patients
- Early neurosurgical consult if not clinically improving and/or abnormal CT scan
- Early retrieval consult if transfer required
- Admit to hospital unless rapid clinical improvement to GCS 15, normal CT scan and absence of other 
risk factors (as per mild head injury)
- Repeat CT scan at 24 hours if not clinically improving or abnormal initial CT scan
- Routine post traumatic amnesia testing and consider referral to brain injury rehabilitation service.
- If clinical or CT evidence of raised ICP/mass effect consider in consultation with network 
neurosurgical service:
  
- short term hyperventilation to PaCO2 30-35
  
- bolus of mannitol (1g/kg)
  
- surgical decompression if more than 2 hours from neurosurgical care
  
- prophylactic anti-convulsants
Outcome:
- Approximately 80-90% of moderate head injury patients improve and should be managed as 
complicated mild head injury while 10-20% deteriorate and require management as per severe head 
injury..
- The majority of patients who suffer moderate head injuries will have some degree of cognitive 
behavioural social sequelae and should be considered for routine follow up with a brain injury 
rehabilitation service or a neurologist (see Appendix 7).
The majority of studies in the literature tend to focus on 
the management of either severe head injuries or mild head 
injuries. The natural history of patients with moderate head 
injuries is that they tend to either deteriorate (10-20%) 
and should then be managed as severe head injuries or 
improve (80-90%) and can be managed as “complicated” 
mild head injuries.40 Patients who present initially with 
moderate head injuries should all have an early CT scan

chunk_46_LEFT,"Recent exhaustive reviews by the Brain Trauma Foundation15 
and the Cochrane Review Group16-30 have looked at the 
management of severe head injuries. The findings of 
these detailed reviews are summarised in Evidence Table 
4. This guideline summarises the generally accepted initial 
management steps for severe head injury including those 
recommended by the current Advanced Trauma Life 
Support course and the Brain Trauma Foundation.15, 40 The 
network neurosurgical service should be consulted about 
further management of patients with severe head injury 
as soon as practical after the initial primary survey and 
resuscitation is completed. 
It is important to recognise that for the majority of severe 
head injury patients the most important aspect of care is 
systematic resuscitation of the ABCDEs with prevention 
of secondary brain injury as per current ATLS guidelines.40 
Resuscitation of the ABCDEs with adequate oxygenation 
and fluid resuscitation and the treatment of other 
immediately life threatening injuries should be the priority 
for patients with severe head injury followed by the CT 
identification of focal intracranial lesions requiring acute 
neurosurgical intervention.40, 157 Early intubation to prevent 
hypoxaemia and facilitate management is recommended.40 
Hyperventilation should be avoided and patients should 
normally be ventilated to maintain normocarbia.24, 158 Fluid 
resuscitation with normal saline or Hartmanns followed 
by blood products to maintain normovolaemia and mean 
arterial pressure is recommended.157 Anticonvulsants are 
usually recommended to prevent early post traumatic 
seizures particularly if there is an abnormal CT scan or 
a history of a witnessed seizure.17, 29, 151 Blood glucose 
and temperature should be monitored and maintained 
in a normal range.159, 160 Thus, good supportive care 
of the ABCDEs, with the prevention of hypoxaemia 
and hypotension, remain the cornerstone of initial 
management.40
The network neurological service should be urgently 
consulted about any patient with an acute neurological 
deterioration suggestive of acutely raised intracranial 
pressure. In the event of acute deterioration, it is important 
to remember that hyperventilation24, 158 and intravenous 
mannitol boluses161,162 are short-term measures to reduce 
intracranial pressure whilst the patient is urgently assessed 
for the need for acute neurosurgical intervention. If an 
acutely deteriorating patient with a proven extradural 
or subdural haematoma cannot be transferred to a 
neurosurgical service within two hours, then the option of 
local surgical decompression should be discussed with the 
neurosurgical service.

chunk_46_RIGHT,"If the referring clinician is unsure about the need for a 
particular therapy, such as prophylactic anticonvulsants 
or antibiotics, then the network neurosurgical service 
should be consulted. There are many other promising 
areas of treatment such as induced hypothermia159, 160 
and hypertonic saline.161 However, there is currently 
insufficient evidence to recommend these as first line 
therapy. Corticosteroids have been shown to worsen the 
patient outcome and are not recommended for the initial 
management of closed head injury.163, 164
Detailed evaluation of subsequent management of severe 
head injuries by the neurosurgical services are beyond the 
scope of these guidelines. There is limited high quality 
evidence to guide management and the relative merits 
of different strategies are hotly debated in the literature. 
The Brain Trauma Foundation review, the Cochrane Group 
reviews, the BMJ Clinical Evidence review165 and recent 
Australian reviews2, 117 all agree that there is no class 1 
evidence to guide management of severe head injury 
patients. However, there is broad consensus agreement 
that strategies to control cerebral perfusion using ICP 
monitoring,27, 28, 61 mild hypothermia26, 66, 135 and 
decompressive craniectomy166 are promising strategies that 
are being widely used and require further study.
Predicting outcome following closed head injury is difficult. 
There have been many attempts to provide scoring 
systems to predict outcome with one of the best known 
being that provided by the CRASH Investigators167. It 
is perhaps prudent to err on the side of caution in the 
initial management setting as at least 24-48 hours of 
investigation and management are required before offering 
any sort of prognosis.",46,RIGHT,258,Page 46 (RIGHT)

A clear decision about the potential need for transfer should be made at the time of initial assessment or 
after a brief period of observation. A senior clinician should be consulted.

chunk_48_LEFT,"Patients with closed head injury should be observed in 
facilities that can manage any complications that are likely 
to arise. Clinical judgment regarding risk of deterioration is

Patients with closed head injury assessed at hospitals 
without CT scanning facilities should be transferred to the 
nearest appropriate hospital if there is significant risk of 
intracranial injury. Transfer of patients to a hospital with CT 
scanning facilities but without neurosurgical services should 
be avoided wherever possible. 
Fabbri et al41 recently published a study in which they 
compared the outcome for mild to moderate head injury 
patients and initial non-neurosurgical lesions on CT scan 
when managed in neurosurgical units versus peripheral 
hospitals. Their system allowed for rapid transfer of patients 
to the tertiary centre in the event of deterioration and used 
a teleradiology link to review CT scans. The outcome for 
patients was not shown to be significantly different. Huynh 
et al168 also showed in a retrospective study that trauma 
patients with GCS 15 and an abnormal CT scan could be 
safely managed without neurosurgical consultation. Both 
these studies would support the current NSW practice of 
managing some head injury patients in non-neurosurgical

10. What analgesia should patients with closed head injury receive?
RECOMMENDATION
Strength of 
recommendation
Analgesia in isolated mild head injury
- Persistent severe headache or worsening severe headache is an indication for a CT scan to exclude a 
signiﬁ cant intracranial lesion
- Most headaches associated with isolated mild head injury will respond to simple analgesia such as 
paracetamol. 
- Isolated mild head injury patients who require more than paracetamol for headache should be 
considered for a CT scan to exclude a signiﬁ cant intracranial injury
Analgesia guide for isolated mild head injury:
- Paracetamol, 1g, q 4-6 hours, maximum 4g/24 hours*
If paracetamol is ineffective as a sole agent then stronger analgesia such as oral opioids or parenteral 
opioids should not be prescribed to patients with isolated mild head injury unless the need for an initial 
or repeat CT scan to exclude clinically important intracranial lesions has been considered and a senior 
clinician has been consulted. After further clinical assessment consider adding;
- Codeine Phosphate, 30-60mg, q 4-6 hours*
                         or
- Oxycodone (immediate release), 5-10mg q 4-6 hours* 
NB Avoid the use of aspirin / NSAIDS due to increased risk of bleeding
* See standard texts for detailed prescribing information
Analgesia guide for mild head injury with associated systemic injuries:
- More likely to need titrated intravenous opioids, procedural sedation or general anaesthesia for their 
associated injuries. 
- Have a lower threshold for performing CT scans.
- Require close clinical assessment and observation.
- Appropriate pain relief should not be withheld due to concerns of masking head injury symptoms 
and signs
- Analgesia needs to be individualised under the supervision of a senior clinician.
Analgesia in moderate to severe head injury
- Likely to require titrated intravenous analgesia and sedation for associated injuries, clinical 
management or intubation. 
- Will require close clinical observation in a high dependency area following initial clinical assessment 
and CT scanning. 
- Analgesia needs to be individualised under the supervision of a senior clinician.
Clinical approach to pain management in closed head injury (all severities)
- Consult a senior clinician if any signiﬁ cant change in the patient’s condition
- Clinically re-assess if:

- excessive drowsiness, or other clinical deterioration
- Before using stronger analgesia:

recommendations are based on existing analgesia clinical 
practice guidelines including those available via the NSW 
Health Clinical Information Access Program (CIAP) such as 
Therapeutic Guidelines.171, 172
Mild head injury
Isolated mild head injury patients
- Most headaches associated with isolated mild head 
injuriy will respond to simple analgesia such as 
paracetamol.
- If paracetamol (1g q 4-6 hr max 4g/day) alone is 
ineffective then codeine phosphate (60mg q 4-6hr 
max 240mg/daily) or low dose immediate release 
oxycodone (5-10mg q 4-6hr) can be added after 
the need for an initial or repeat CT scan to exclude 
a clinically significant intracranial lesion has been 
considered.
- The aim of analgesia in patients with isolated mild 
head injury with associated headache should be to 
relieve pain without causing excessive drowsiness. 
Patients should always remain easy to rouse.
- Analgesics containing aspirin or NSAIDs should not be 
used due to the increased risk of bleeding from platelet 
dysfunction.
- Patients with persistent or worsening severe headaches 
requesting increasing analgesia should be clinically 
reassessed and the need for a CT scan to exclude a 
clinically significant intracranial lesion considered.
- Patients who are already drowsy or difficult to rouse 
should not be given additional opioids due to the risk 
of respiratory depression. Patients with persistent or 
worsening drowsiness should be clinically reassessed.
- If a headache has not responded to simple analgesics 
or a patient is abnormally drowsy following analgesia 
then the patient should be clinically re-assessed for 
potential complications. Specific questions that should 
be considered include:

cranial lesion?
 
3)  Has a senior clinician been notified/consulted

opioid or parenteral opioid should not be prescribed to 
patients with isolated mild head injury unless a senior 
clinician has been consulted and clinically important 
complications considered.

 Mild head injury patients with other associated 
injuries
- The same general principles outlined for isolated 
mild head injury patients apply. However, mild head 
injury patients with other associated injuries are more 
likely to need titrated intravenous opioids, procedural 
sedation or general anaesthesia for their associated 
injuries.
- Clearly, this has the potential to mask signs of 
worsening head injury. Therefore, these patients 
require close clinical observation and clinicians should 
have a low threshold for performing CT scans on mild 
head injury patients requiring intravenous opioids,",50,RIGHT,252,Page 50 (RIGHT)

associated injuries.
- Appropriate pain relief should not be withheld due to 
concerns of masking head injury symptoms and signs 
as the patients pain is likely to make clinical assessment 
more difficult and mask other signs of injury and the 
patient should not be allowed to suffer unnecessarily.
Moderate to severe head injury
- Isolated moderate head injury patients who rapidly 
clinically improve can be treated in a similar way to 
mild head injury patients. They all require an initial CT 
- However, most moderate head injury patients and 
nearly all severe head injury patients will require 
titrated intravenous analgesia and sedation for 
associated injuries, clinical management or intubation. 
These patients will all require close clinical observation 
in a high dependency area following initial clinical 
assessment and CT scanning. Analgesia needs to be 
individualised under the supervision of senior clinicians.
- Routine analgesia with intravenous opioids is 
recommended for most intubated patients as pain 
may cause adverse effects on blood pressure and 
intracranial pressure.

Speciﬁ c indications to consider prophylactic anti-convulsants in the ﬁ rst week following a head injury 
include:
- Extradural, subdural or intracerebral haematoma on CT
- Depressed skull fracture on CT
- Early post traumatic seizure in hospital (especially if focal or prolonged)
- Severity of head injury (low initial GCS / prolonged coma / prolonged PTA)
- Any suspicion of penetrating injury
Prophylactic anti-convulsants decrease the incidence of early post traumatic seizures within seven days 
of closed head injury.
Early post traumatic seizures have not been shown to be associated with worse patient outcomes in 
large population studies.

Clinical judgment is required on whether to prescribe anti-convulsants for individual patients.
CONSENSUS
Indications for anti-convulsants by post traumatic seizure type
Immediate post traumatic seizures (at time of injury) 
- Anti-convulsants not warranted unless speciﬁ c indication present (see above)
Early post traumatic seizures ( up to 7 days post injury)
- Anti-convulsants should be considered especially if any of the other speciﬁ c indications are also 
present (see above) 
Late post traumatic seizures (more than 7 days post injury)
- Long term anti-convulsants should be considered after the ﬁ rst late post traumatic seizure due to the 
increased risk of developing post traumatic epilepsy
- There is no evidence that the routine use of anti-convulsants following closed head injury reduces 
the risk of late post traumatic seizures.

chunk_53_LEFT,"Post traumatic seizures are a recognised complication of 
closed head injuries with incidence depending largely on 
severity of injury. Penetrating injuries have a much higher 
incidence of post traumatic seizures. Post traumatic seizures 
are classified as either immediate, early (0-7 days) or late/
delayed (>7 days).144 Immediate and early post traumatic 
seizures are thought to be associated with the acute injury 
and are not significantly associated with the development 
of post traumatic epilepsy. Late post traumatic seizures 
are less likely to be related to the acute injury and are 
more likely to be associated with the development of post 
traumatic epilepsy.144 
Brief generalised post traumatic seizures immediately 
following mild head injury are not usually associated with 
poor outcome or intracranial injury. These immediate 
seizures are frequently seen on sporting fields and in 
young children. It has been proposed that these immediate 
seizures be called “concussive convulsions” and it has been 
suggested that they are not an epileptic phenomena.64, 
107, 134 McCrory et al145 demonstrated that outcome was 
universally good for these “concussive convulsions” in elite 
Australian sportsmen.
Immediate and early post traumatic seizures are relatively 
common in patients with mild closed head injury with a 
reported incidence of up to 5%.144, 173 The literature is 
somewhat contradictory about the risk of seizures being 
associated with intracranial injury. Many of the larger 
studies found that post traumatic seizures were not 
significantly associated with intracranial injury.85, 115, 168, 172, 
174 However, Haydel et al32 found that they were significant 
and Smits et al47 found that while they were not statistically 
significant, included them in their decision rule because 
of their perceived clinical importance. Neidlinger et al146 
found that the “yield of unsuspected major intracranial 
abnormality on CT scan justifies a policy of its routine 
use in trauma patients with seizure or who are post ictal, 
regardless of prior seizure history.”
Immediate or early post traumatic seizures are more 
common (up to 30%) in patients with moderate to severe 
closed head injury, and are more likely to be associated with 
significant intracranial injury.144, 173 There is an association 
with underlying structural lesions and the potential for 
secondary brain injury especially with prolonged, focal 
or delayed seizures. Any moderate to severe head injury 
patient who has a post traumatic seizure warrants a CT 
scan to exclude significant underlying pathology and 
then the need for prophylactic anti-convulsants should be 
considered.
Initial Management of Closed Head Injury in Adults, 2nd Edition  NSW HEALTH  PAGE 51",53,LEFT,409,Page 53 (LEFT)
chunk_53_RIGHT,"The major risk factors for developing early post traumatic 
seizures include lower initial GCS, depressed skull fracture, 
penetrating injury, extradural/subdural/intracerebral 
haematomas and young age.12, 17, 29, 64, 182 The risk is 
therefore related to the amount of structural damage. 
Penetrating injury provides the greatest risk. The risk posed 
by an intracranial bleed is proportional to the amount of 
blood. 
Delayed or late post traumatic seizures (incidence range 
1-15%) that occur more than seven days after injury are 
associated with the development of post traumatic epilepsy. 
Risk factors for late post traumatic seizures include lower 
initial GCS, depressed skull fracture, penetrating injury, 
extradural/subdural/intracerebral haematomas, elderly (age 
>65), neurosurgical intervention and early post traumatic 
seizures.12, 17, 29, 64, 182 
Acute post traumatic seizures require systematic 
reassessment of the ABCDEs to exclude systemic causes and 
termination with benzodiazepines if required. Underlying 
structural lesions should be excluded with CT scan and then 
the need for prophylactic anti-convulsants considered.
If prophylactic anti-convulsants are recommended then 
phenytoin (dilantin) is normally given as there has been 
extensive experience with its use and it can be given as 
either an oral or an intravenous loading dose.11, 17, 29, 69, 
151 Alternatives include sodium valproate (epilim) and 
levetiracetam (keppra). Levetiracetam is being increasingly 
used in both non traumatic and traumatic epilepsy due 
to its better side effect profile and may become first line 
therapy in the future.174, 175 However, there is limited 
experience with its use in the trauma setting and phenytoin 
remains the first line therapy at present.
- Current evidence suggests that anti-convulsants 
decrease the incidence of early post traumatic seizures 
within seven days of closed head injury.17, 29, 151 
- Early post traumatic seizures have not been shown to 
be clearly associated with worse patient outcome.17, 29, 
- There is no evidence that prophylactic anti-convulsants 
following closed head injury reduce the risk of late post 
traumatic seizures.17, 29, 151 
- Anti-convulsants as a group have many potential side 
effects and are relatively poorly tolerated by patients 
long term.17, 29, 151",53,RIGHT,334,Page 53 (RIGHT)
chunk_54_LEFT,"- Clinical judgement is therefore required to balance 
the potential benefits versus potential harm of anticonvulsants for individual patients with closed head 
injury. 
- Anti-convulsants are therefore only indicated in the 
first week following closed head injury to reduce the 
risk of complications from early post traumatic seizures. 
They should not be routinely continued long term.
- In most patients with mild head injury prophylactic 
anti-convulsants are not indicated.
- Specific indications to consider prophylactic anticonvulsants in the first week following a closed head 
injury include:
 
-  Extradural, subdural or intracerebral haematoma on 
 
- Depressed skull fracture on CT
 
- Early post traumatic seizure in hospital
 
-  Severity of injury (low GCS / duration of coma / 
duration of PTA)
 
- Any penetrating injury
- Long term anti-convulsants should be considered after 
the first or second late post traumatic seizure (ie after 
the diagnosis of post traumatic epilepsy).17, 29, 50, 132 
Mild head injury
In most patients with mild head injury prophylactic anticonvulsants are not indicated. The risk of seizures is low 
and the risk of secondary brain injury is low. Mild head 
injury patients who have had an early post traumatic 
seizure in hospital and those with structural lesions such as 
depressed skull fractures or focal intracranial haematomas 
on CT scan should be considered for anti-convulsants and 
discussed with a neurosurgical service. 
 Moderate to severe head injury
In moderate and severe head injury patients there is a 
stronger case to consider prophylactic anti-convulsants 
especially in those with structural lesions on CT scan. The 
risk of early post traumatic seizures is greater and the 
potential for secondary brain injury from these seizures is 
increased. Prolonged post traumatic seizures are of most 
concern and may be difficult to recognise in intubated 
patients. Therefore, prophylactic anti-convulsants are more 
likely to be recommended in these patients. It should 
be noted that most intubated patients in NSW receive 
analgesia and sedation with morphine and midazolam 
infusions and so are already receiving a benzodiazepine 
anti-convulsant. The decision to use anti-convulsants should 
be discussed with the relevant neurosurgical service.

The A-WPTAS combined with a standardised GCS 
assessment is an objective measure of post traumatic 
amnesia (PTA).   
Only for patients with current GCS of 13-15 (<24hrs 
post injury) with impact to the head resulting in confusion, 
disorientation, anterograde or retrograde amnesia, or brief 
LOC. Administer both tests at hourly intervals to gauge 
patient’s capacity for full orientation and ability to retain new 
information. Also, note the following: poor motivation, 
depression, pre-morbid intellectual handicap or possible 
medication, drug or alcohol effects. NB: This is a screening 
device, so exercise clinical judgement. In cases where 
doubt exists, more thorough assessment may be
necessary.
Admission and Discharge Criteria: 
A patient is considered to be out of PTA when they score 
18/18.
Both the GCS and A-WPTAS should be used in conjunction 
with clinical judgement. 
Patients scoring 18/18 can be considered for discharge. 
For patients who do not obtain 18/18 re-assess after a 
further hour. 
Patients with persistent score <18/18 at 4 hours post time 
of injury should be considered for admission. 
Clinical judgement and consideration of pre-existing 
conditions should be used where the memory component 
of A-WPTAS is abnormal but the GCS is normal (15/15).

Administration and Scoring 
1. Orientation Questions
Question 1: WHAT IS YOUR NAME?  
The patient must provide their full name.
Question 2: WHAT IS THE NAME OF THIS PLACE?  
The patient has to be able to give the name of the hospital. For example: Westmead Hospital. (NB: The 
patient does not get any points for just saying ‘hospital’.) If the patient can not name the hospital, give them a 
choice of 3 options. To do this, pick 2 other similar sized hospitals in your local area or neighbouring region. In 
Westmead Hospital’s case the 3 choices are ‘Nepean Hospital, Westmead Hospital or Liverpool Hospital’. 
Question 3: WHY ARE YOU HERE? 
The patient must know why they were brought into hospital. e.g. they were injured in a car accident, fell, 
assaulted or injured playing sport. If the patient does not know, give them three options, including the correct 
reason.
Question 4: WHAT MONTH ARE WE IN?  
For emphasis the examiner can ask what month are we in now? The patient must name the month. For 
example, if the patient answers ‘the 6th month’, the examiner must ask the further question ‘What is the 6th 
month called?’. 
Question 5: WHAT YEAR ARE WE IN?  
It is considered correct for patients to answer in the short form ‘08’, instead of ‘2008’. Also, an acceptable 
alternative prompt (for the rest of the 2000’s) is ‘The year is 2000 and what?’

about 5 seconds and ensure that they can repeat the names of each card. Tell the patient to remember the 
pictures for the next testing in about one hour. Picture Cards at each subsequent time T2-T5: Ask patient, 
“What were the three pictures that I showed you earlier?”  Scoring:

Associate Professor Paul M Middleton
Introduction
Impairment of consciousness is one of the most consistent 
features of head injury, and the Glasgow Coma Scale 
(GCS) was described by Teasdale and Jennett in 1974192, 
based on a theoretical model of level of consciousness. 
It was introduced as a simple tool, not to allow absolute 
distinctions between levels of consciousness, but to be an 
effective method of accurately describing the various states 
of impairment within the continuum of consciousness.192 
As the authors stated in the original paper “In the acute 
stage, changes in conscious level provide the best indication 
of the development of complications such as intracranial 
haematoma, whilst the depth of coma and its duration 
indicate the degree of ultimate recovery which can be 
expected”. Prior to this most descriptions of altered 
levels of consciousness revolved around very subjective 
portrayals such as “comatose”, “drowsy”, “obtunded”, and 
“stuporose”.193
The GCS was originally described by the authors as a 
repeated bedside assessment of the “…depth and duration 
of impaired consciousness and coma”192, and was used to 
objectively determine the severity of coma and underlying 
brain dysfunction at six hours following head trauma. This 
time frame was chosen to avoid overestimation of brain 
damage produced by temporary factors such as alcohol, 
hypoxia or hypotension,193 and similarly the GCS should be 
recorded prior to any sedation.
The GCS has also been incorporated as the neurological 
component of assessment into various aggregate scores 
such as APACHE and TRISS,193 and it has been found that 
taking out this neurological component worsened predictive 
ability, which led to the presumption that neurological 
status is the best predictor of overall functional outcome.194 
The GCS makes up 17% of the theoretical maximum Acute 
Physiology Score (APS) in APACHE II, 19% of the APS in 
APACHE III195 and is the basis of the World Federation of 
neurosurgeons (WFNS) subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) 
grading scale.196 
The GCS, in actual fact, has evolved through both design 
and common usage to fulfil multiple functions, which are 
PAGE 94  Initial Management of Closed Head Injury in Adults, 2nd Edition  NSW HEALTH",96,LEFT,355,Page 96 (LEFT)
chunk_96_RIGHT,"summarised in the list below. The GCS can be said to…
- Aid in clinical decision making in interventions such as 
airway management or intensive care admission
- Describe, quantitate and add structure to the 
assessment of coma
- Facilitate and standardise communication between 
clinicians
- Enable monitoring of change in both component 
and overall scores, i.e. trends in the early stages after 
injury, allowing rapid detection of complications and 
discriminating between those at higher or lower risk of 
complications
- Be an indicator of the severity of illness
- Facilitate comparison between groups of patients
- Allow triage of patients after injury
- Provide a tool for prognostication
- Allow standardisation of patients and patient groups 
for research
The important primary uses for the GCS can be distilled 
from this list to…
- Act as an indicator of the level injury and illness, 
allowing triage and immediate intervention when 
required, as well as to enable monitoring by the 
provision of valid measurements and trends of level of 
consciousness
- Facilitate understanding, clear description and 
communication between clinicians. This should enable 
one clinician to describe the level of consciousness to 
another, whether face-to-face or remotely, in the sure 
knowledge that this description precisely represents 
the injury, physiological and functional state of the 
patient and that the receiving clinician may accurately 
comprehend this from the description.",96,RIGHT,225,Page 96 (RIGHT)
chunk_97_LEFT,"The original authors believed that measurement of 
consciousness should not depend on a single measure, so 
the GCS was designed to utilise the three domains of eye 
opening, verbal response and motor response.193 These 
domains were chosen as they represent differing aspects of 
central nervous system function, measured independently 
of each other, with scores in rank order that indicate the 
degree of dysfunction. The domains are represented by 
three different behavioural responses, each assessable in 
the absence of the others, and the GCS was therefore 
considered to be more appropriate and effective than the 
imposition of subjective “levels” of function. The total GCS 
is time-efficient, and considered to be easy to sum.197
The eye opening component refers to the processing of 
information by the cerebral cortex and the level of arousal 
or wakefulness.193 The verbal response domain measures

chunk_97_RIGHT,"integration within the nervous system and the presence 
of speech represents a high degree of this integration.193 
The motor response is considered a good indicator of the 
ability of the nervous system to function properly due to 
the variety of possible motion patterns192, 193 and is also 
considered to represent that part of the central nervous 
system least affected by trauma.193 Total GCS up to 8 
largely reflects changes in motor response, referring to 
patients with no eye opening or verbal response; response 
scores from 9-15 depend more on eye opening and verbal 
response.198 Changes in the eye and verbal responses, 
and thus higher overall scores, are useful in discriminating 
between patients with less severe impairment of 
consciousness. One research group found that increasing 
scores in the 9-15 range (reflecting improving eye and 
verbal performances) are associated with a doubling of the 
rate of good recovery in survivors of head injury.199",97,RIGHT,151,Page 97 (RIGHT)
chunk_98_LEFT,"Importantly, to facilitate these uses, an exact understanding 
of the terminology encompassed in the GCS, of the 
pathophysiological reactions underpinning response, and 
of the methodology by which various clinicians examine 
and describe the level of consciousness using the GCS, 
are essential. Unfortunately, not only are many clinicians 
unaware what the descriptions of patient reaction to a 
stimulus mean, but there also appears to be very variable 
teaching and practice in the detail of how to perform 
the examination. Studies have shown varying degrees 
of agreement between groups of clinicians performing 
the examination and assessing the level of consciousness 
with the GCS. Despite the high degree of consistency 
reported by the authors of the GCS,200 one 2004 
study201 showed only moderate agreement between two 
emergency physicians who assessed the GCS of a broad 
range of patients with differing pathologies, and a further

chunk_98_RIGHT,"emergency physician-based study by the same authors 
comparing different types of score found similarly low 
values.201 An Australian emergency department study 
comparing an emergency physician with a registered nurse 
found excellent agreement in the verbal and total GCS 
scores, but only intermediate agreement in the motor and 
eye scores.202 Given other work which suggests that the 
motor score is the most discriminating part of the GCS,203 
this is a cause for some concern.
Given that there is little formal training in the application 
of the GCS and that definitions of the appropriate stimuli 
to apply and the details of the responses to observe, are 
similarly scanty, it was considered useful to review the 
literature and produce a didactic guide which can be used 
by all practitioners, and attempt to increase the agreement 
in the clinical setting.",98,RIGHT,136,Page 98 (RIGHT)
chunk_99_LEFT,"Assessment
An eye component score of 3 or 4 implies that information 
processing is occurring and that the related arousal 
mechanisms at the brain stem are functioning,193 whereas 
a eye component score of 2 indicates that lower levels of 
the brain are functioning.193 It is not true however that 
eye opening indicates awareness; for instance patients in 
a persistent vegetative state may have spontaneous eye 
opening, and in this instance this is a reflexive action and 
does not indicate awareness of self or surroundings.197
Verbal 
As stated above, presence of speech implies a high level of 
integration in the nervous system, although it is important 
to remember that a lack of speech may be attributed to 
other factors such as tracheostomy or dysphasia. A lack of 
speech due to local factors such as this need to be carefully 
considered, as including a low score cause by local factors 
into a GCS, especially when only the sum is being used, 
falsely decreases the score. It is important to remember that 
the GCS is a measure of level of consciousness, and use a 
tracheostomy in an otherwise fully conscious patient to give 
a decreased GCS is clearly counter-intuitive and incorrect.
In terms of the gradations of verbal component score, 
oriented indicates that the patient is aware of his / her 
self and the surrounding environment,197 and is usually 
described in terms of questions about patient’s name, the 
role of the person asking the questions, the month and 
year, and the name of the hospital or health care facility. 
Confused patients can carry on a conversation but the 
content betrays disorientation and misunderstanding of 
the components described above. Inappropriate words 
describes clear and comprehensible speech,197 but using 
random words or swearing and cursing. Repeating words or 
perseveration also falls into this category. Incomprehensible 
sounds refers to moaning and groaning without 
recognisable words,197 even when an attempt to articulate 
words is being made. It is important to differentiate 
between a patient with a decreased level of consciousness 
and reduced cognition, who is unable to form words in 
response to stimulus, and an awake stroke patient for 
instance; whose dysphasia may make the task impossible. 
Clearly, the second case does not represent the situation 
which the GCS is designed to measure. None means that 
the patient is unable to verbalise at all,197 and is subject to 
the factors described above.
Initial Management of Closed Head Injury in Adults, 2nd Edition  NSW HEALTH  PAGE 97",99,LEFT,409,Page 99 (LEFT)
chunk_99_RIGHT,"Motor
Motor component scores of 6, 5 and 4 imply the presence 
of a degree of cerebral function and thus the ability 
to react appropriately to a noxious stimulus. Obeys 
commands indicates an ability to process and obey verbal 
commands;197 localisation means that the patient is able 
to identify the location of a painful stimulus and attempt 
to remove it, an action often accompanied by the upper 
extremity of a patient purposefully crossing the midline 
to remove the stimulus193, 197. Withdrawal means that 
the patient is attempting to move away from the noxious 
stimulus, sometimes by adopting a fetal position.197 This 
last position is particularly important when there is an 
inexperienced observer, as differentiating a localising 
response from an abnormal flexion response may prove 
difficult.195
A motor component score of 3, or an abnormal flexor 
response, implies that the lesion is located in the cerebral 
hemispheres or internal capsule,193 whereas a score of 
2 describes a midbrain to upper pontine damage.193 
Abnormal flexor response is complex, but involves 
adduction of upper limbs, with flexion of arms, wrists 
and fingers. Accompanying this are extension and 
internal rotation of lower limbs, and plantar flexion of 
feet. This must be differentiated from the normal flexor 
response or withdrawal, but also from extensor posturing 
which indicates a lesion lower in the central nervous 
system, and therefore reflecting CNS function at a lower 
level.193 Extensor posturing includes the same lower limb 
appearances as in abnormal flexion, but with the upper 
limbs adopting a different position; this is described as 
extension of the upper limbs along the sides of the body, 
accompanied by pronation of the forearms. Abnormal 
flexion and extensor posturing are often known by the 
terms decerebrate and decorticate response, implying the 
level of loss of CNS function, and studies have shown that 
patients showing extensor posturing are more likely to 
have a poor outcome than those with abnormal flexion.197 
If a patient demonstrates flexion on one side of the body, 
and extension on the other, the best of the two responses 
needs to be recorded.193
None means that the patient is flaccid, and does not make 
any movement in response to a painful stimulus. In these 
circumstances, it is essential to check that the patient is 
not pharmacologically or pathologically paralysed. Bear in 
mind again, that as the GCS is endeavouring to measure 
cognition and that abnormal motor responses, due to 
the presence of anaesthetic paralysis or spinal cord injury",99,RIGHT,407,Page 99 (RIGHT)
chunk_100_LEFT,"invalidates the motor score at this time, in this patient, as 
a means to measure consciousness. Another important 
caveat to the measurement of the motor score component 
of the GCS is that the simple “squeeze my fingers” is NOT 
sufficient or appropriate to demonstrate this function.197 A 
grasp reflex an be elicited in many patients with decreased 
cognition, similar to that found in babies, and attempts at 
least have to include the command to release the fingers 
after squeezing them, and this must be seen to be obeyed. 
More specific commands such as “show me two fingers” 
are more appropriate.
In the sections above, there are various conditions discussed 
which invalidate the measurement of specific domains of 
the GCS, however it must always be borne in mind that 
this tool is designed to assess consciousness and cognition, 
and that local lesions of many descriptions invalidate this 
measurement, and should therefore not be counted into 
an overall score at all, and should not be counted into 
a domain score without documented explanation. If a 
domain of the GCS, such as eye opening or verbal response 
is confounded by local lesions, then both snapshots and 
trends should be limited to the use of the other domains.192, 
193 Since the motor score has been shown to contain most 
of the predictive power of the GCS, especially in the more 
severely head injured patients, it would be reasonable to 
use this alone in these circumstances. When this occurs, 
it has been recommended that a 1 is scored,197 however 
if this is done it has to be accompanied by a written 
explanation and the caveat that this cannot be used in an 
overall score.
Conditions such as alcohol, drugs, inability to understand 
commands due to language barriers, and hearing 
impairment are all conditions that may confound the 
performance of a GCS, and once again consideration 
needs to be given to the reason for measuring cognition. 
For example, if the reason the GCS is being measured 
is to assess the level of consciousness associated with a 
head injury or pathological cause of decreased conscious 
level, conditions such as alcohol or sedative drugs are a 
confounder which invalidate the GCS; however, if the 
measurement is being used to assess the effect of drugs on 
the level of consciousness, this is then the relevant effect 
being measured. In these circumstances, however, many of 
the correlates of a decreased level of consciousness in head 
injury measured by GCS may not be accurate; such as an 
inability to protect the airway associated with a GCS 8, 
which is often not true in patients obtunded with certain 
drugs of abuse. An extended list of potential confounders is 
shown below.

lateralisation as it measures the best response rather than

Important points about Mild Head Injury
You had a mild head injury. Most people recover rapidly following a mild head injury. A few people may suffer from 
symptoms over a longer period. 
There is a small risk of you developing serious complications so you should be watched closely by another adult for 
24 hours after the accident. Please read the following. It outlines what signs to look out for after a head injury 
and what you need to do if you have problems.
Warning Signs
!
If you show any of these symptoms or signs after your head injury, or you get worse , go to 
the nearest hospital, doctor or telephone an ambulance immediately.
Fainting or drowsiness - or you can’t wake up 
 
❖
Acting strange, saying things that do not make sense (change in behaviour) 
 
❖
A constant severe headache or a headache that gets worse 
 
❖
Vomiting or throwing up more than twice
 
❖
Cannot remember new events, recognise people or places (increased confusion)
 
❖
Pass out or have a blackout or a seizure (any jerking of the body or limbs)
 
❖
Cannot move parts of your body or clumsiness
 
❖
Blurred vision or slurred speech
 
❖
Continual ﬂuid or bleeding from the ear or nose
 
❖
The ﬁrst 24-48 hours after injury
Warning Signs
You should be observed and return to hospital if you develop any of 
the above warning signs.
Rest / Sleeping
Rest and avoid strenuous activity for at least 24 hours. It is alright for you to 
sleep tonight but you should be checked every four hours by someone to make 
sure you are alright.
Driving
Do not drive for at least 24 hours. You should not drive until you feel much 
better and can concentrate properly. Talk to your doctor.
Drinking / 
Drugs
Do not drink alcohol or take sleeping pills or recreational drugs in the next 48 
hours. All of these can make you feel worse.They also make it hard for other 
people to tell whether the injury is affecting you or not.  
Pain Relief
Use paracetamol or paracetamol/codeine for headaches.  Do not use 
aspirin or anti inﬂammatory pain reliever such as ibuprofen or naproxen 
(NSAIDs), which may increase the risk of complications.
Sports
Do not play sports for at least 24 hours.
See your local doctor if you are not starting to feel better within a few days of your injury.

chunk_104_LEFT,"The ﬁrst 4 weeks after injury 
You may have some common effects from the head injury which usually resolve in several weeks to three months. These are 
called post concussive symptoms (see below). Tiredness can exaggerate the symptoms. Return to your normal activities 
gradually (not all at once) during the ﬁrst weeks or months. You can help yourself get better by:
Rest / Sleeping
Your brain needs time to recover. It is important to get adequate amounts of sleep 
as you may feel more tired than normal.  
Driving
Do not drive or operate machinery until you feel much better and can concentrate 
properly. Talk to your doctor.
Drinking / Drugs
Do not drink alcohol or use recreational drugs until you are fully recovered . They 
will make you feel much worse. Do not take medication unless advised by your 
doctor. 
Work / Study
You may need to take time off work or study until you can concentrate better. Most 
people need a day or two off work but are back full time in less than 2 weeks. How 
much time you need off work or study will depend on the type of job you do. See 
your doctor and let your employer or teachers know if you are having problems at 
work or with study.  You may need to return to study or work gradually. 
Sport / Lifestyle
It is dangerous for the brain to be injured again if is has not recovered from the ﬁrst 
injury. Talk to your doctor about the steps you need to take to gradually increase 
sports activity and return to play. If in doubt “sit it out”. 
Relationships
Sometimes your symptoms will affect your relationship with family and friends. You 
may suffer irritability and mood swings. See your doctor if you or your family are 
worried. 
Recovery
You should start to feel better within a few days and be ‘back to normal’ within about 4 weeks. See your 
local doctor if you are not starting to feel better.
Your doctor will monitor these symptoms and may refer you to a specialist if you do not improve over 4 
weeks up to 3 months. 
Post Concussion Symptoms 
There are common symptoms after a mild head injury. They usually go away within a few days or weeks. 
Sometimes you may not be aware of them until sometime after your injury like when you return to work.
Feeling more tired than usual and  lacking energy 
 
❖
Mild headaches (that won’t go away)
 
❖
Having more trouble than usual with  attention & 
 
❖
Irritability. Losing your temper and getting annoyed 
 
❖
concentration
Having more trouble than usual with remembering 
 
❖
Mood swings
 
❖
things (memory difﬁculties/forgetfulness)
Anxiety or depression
 
❖
Feeling dizzy or sick without vomiting (nausea)
 
❖
Mild behavioural change
 
❖
Balance problems
 
❖
More sensitive to sounds or lights
 
❖
More difﬁculty than usual with making decisions 
 
❖
and solving problems, getting things done or being 
organised
Change in sleep patterns. Trouble sleeping or sleeping 
 
❖
Feeling vague, slowed or “foggy” thinking

A8.1 
General search strategy
Comprehensive search strategies for both Medline and 
Embase were guided by each of the clinical questions. A 
general text-word based strategy was used to search the 
Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), the 
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) 
and SCOPUS. The searches were executed for the period 
1980 to 30th October 2004 (1st Ed.) and updated for 
the 2nd Ed. (2004-2010). The results from each of these 
searches were filtered in accordance with the exclusion 
and inclusion criteria (see below) and then assessed for 
relevance to the clinical questions. The search strategies are 
listed in Appendix 9.
In addition, reference lists of previous guidelines and key 
papers were used to identify other key references, including 
pre-2004 literature. SCOPUS and Google Scholar were used 
to execute author-based searches, citation mapping and 
grey literature searching. The following websites were also 
searched (using relevant free text terms):

Strength of recommendations
This guideline uses the National Health and Medical 
Research Council (NHMRC) overall grades of 
recommendation to indicate the strength of the body of 
evidence underpinning each recommendation. The body 
of evidence reflects the evidence components of all the 
studies relevant to each recommendation. The evidence 
components are assessed according to the NHMRC body 
of evidence matrix (see table below). The overall grade of 
the recommendation is determined based on a summation 
of the rating for each individual component of the body of 
evidence. Please note that a recommendation cannot be 
graded A or B unless the evidence base and consistency of 
the evidence are both rated A or B.44

 Quality assessment for individual 
studies used in guidelines
A8.5.1  Introduction
The quality of each study is an assessment of the 
methodological quality (or internal validity), and is the 
extent to which the study’s design, conduct and analysis 
has minimised selection, measurement and confounding 
biases. The process used to assess the studies included in 
Good studies
Low risk of bias
Have most or all of the relevant quality items
Fair studies
Susceptible to some bias, but not sufﬁ cient to 
invalidate results
Poor studies
High risk of bias arising from signiﬁ cant
