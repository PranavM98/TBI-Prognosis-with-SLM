The risk from radiation can either be expressed as an 
estimated lifetime risk of fatal cancer or as an estimated 
equivalent dose of radiation which takes into account organ 
doses and their relative radiosensitivity.122, 123, 127, 128, 130 It 
is important to recognise that these risks are all estimates 
based on epidemiological studies of atomic bomb survivors 
extrapolated to current estimated doses of radiation 
delivered by CT scans. Perhaps the best way to put the risk 
of CT scanning into perspective is to compare the estimated 
risks with more common everyday risks.129 
Put into context the risk of radiation from an individual 
head CT scan is very low.122, 123, 127-130
- 
Estimated overall lifetime risk of fatal cancer (1 in 3)
- Estimated risk of clinically important lesion on CT in 
mild head injury (1 in 100)
- Estimated additional lifetime risk of fatal cancer from 
adult trauma panscan (1 in 1,000)
- Estimated additional lifetime risk of fatal cancer from 
single child CT head (1 in 5,000)
- Estimated additional lifetime risk of fatal cancer from 
single adult CT head (1 in 10,000)
- Estimated additional lifetime risk of fatal cancer from 
trauma series x-rays (1 in 20,000)
- Estimated additional lifetime risk of fatal cancer from 
single chest x-ray (1 in 1,000,000)
- Estimated equivalent dose of radiation from a chest 
x-ray (0.02 mSv per CXR)
- Estimated equivalent dose of radiation from adult CT 
head (2 mSv per scan) 
- Estimated equivalent dose of radiation from annual 
background radiation (2 mSv per year)
- Estimated equivalent dose of radiation from adult CT 
trauma panscan (20 mSv per scan)
- Annual safety limit for radiation exposure for radiation 
workers (.20 mSv per year)
- Estimated mean equivalent dose of radiation exposure 
for atomic bomb survivors linked to increased rates of 
fatal cancer (40 mSv dose)
It is important to recognise that the absolute risk to an 
individual is relatively small particularly with advancing 
age. More caution is recommended in children due to 
the concerns on cognitive development as well as lifetime 
risk of cancer. The lifetime risk of cancer for a young child 
receiving a CT head would be roughly double that of an 
adult (1 in 5000).
