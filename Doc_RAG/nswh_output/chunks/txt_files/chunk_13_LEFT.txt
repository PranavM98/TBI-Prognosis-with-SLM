Overall grade A or B recommendations are generally based 
on a body of evidence that can be trusted to guide clinical 
practice, whereas Grades C or D recommendations must 
be applied carefully to individual clinical and organisational 
circumstances and should be interpreted with care (see 
table below).44 This guideline also utilises an additional 
grade of “Consensus” where appropriate.
Grade of 
recommendation
Description
A
Body of evidence can be trusted to guide practice
B
Body of evidence can be trusted to guide practice in most situations
C
Body of evidence provides some support for recommendation(s) but care should be taken in its 
application
D
Body of evidence is weak and recommendation must be applied with caution
Consensus
When limited literature was available, the author and editorial group utilised the best available 
clinical expertise, practices and accepted teachings to reach a consensus on the recommendation
Level of evidence
‘Level of Evidence’, applied to individual articles, refers 
to the study design used to minimise bias. Each article is 
classified according to their general purpose and study type 
Level I
Evidence obtained from a systematic review of all relevant randomised control trials
Level II
Evidence obtained from at least one properly-designed randomised control trial
Level III-1
Evidence obtained from well-designed pseudo-randomised controlled trials (alternate allocation or 
some other method)
Level III-2
Evidence obtained from comparative studies (including systematic reviews of such studies) with 
concurrent controls and allocation not randomised, cohort studies, case-control studies, or 
interrupted time series with a control group
Level III-3
Evidence obtained from comparative studies with historical control, two or more single arm studies 
or interrupted time series without a parallel control group
Level IV
Evidence obtained from a case-series, either post-test or pre-test/post-test
