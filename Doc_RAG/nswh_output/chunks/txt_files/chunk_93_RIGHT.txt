The A-WPTAS combined with a standardised GCS 
assessment is an objective measure of post traumatic 
amnesia (PTA).   
Only for patients with current GCS of 13-15 (<24hrs 
post injury) with impact to the head resulting in confusion, 
disorientation, anterograde or retrograde amnesia, or brief 
LOC. Administer both tests at hourly intervals to gauge 
patientâ€™s capacity for full orientation and ability to retain new 
information. Also, note the following: poor motivation, 
depression, pre-morbid intellectual handicap or possible 
medication, drug or alcohol effects. NB: This is a screening 
device, so exercise clinical judgement. In cases where 
doubt exists, more thorough assessment may be
necessary.
Admission and Discharge Criteria: 
A patient is considered to be out of PTA when they score 
18/18.
Both the GCS and A-WPTAS should be used in conjunction 
with clinical judgement. 
Patients scoring 18/18 can be considered for discharge. 
For patients who do not obtain 18/18 re-assess after a 
further hour. 
Patients with persistent score <18/18 at 4 hours post time 
of injury should be considered for admission. 
Clinical judgement and consideration of pre-existing 
conditions should be used where the memory component 
of A-WPTAS is abnormal but the GCS is normal (15/15). 
Referral to GP on discharge if abnormal PTA was present, 
provide patient advice sheet.
