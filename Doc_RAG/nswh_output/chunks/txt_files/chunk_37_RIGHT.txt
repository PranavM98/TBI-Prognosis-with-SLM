mental status at two hours post injury.
From a practical viewpoint, clinically obvious drug or alcohol 
intoxication should be treated as a risk factor for intracranial 
injury because it manifests as abnormal mental status which 
impairs clinical assessment and must be assumed to be 
due to intracranial injury. It seems reasonable to use the 
approach of Stiell et al35 in determining when to order a CT 
scan in the absence of other risk factors.
Dangerous mechanisms of injury
Specifically identified high risk dangerous 
mechanisms that are a strong indication for CT 
scanning include pedestrian/cyclist struck by vehicle, 
ejection from vehicle, falls (>1m) and focal blunt 
trauma to the head (bat, ball, foot). In the absence 
of these specified risk factors or other risk factors, 
dangerous mechanism is a relative indication for CT 
scan in mild head injury patients. Clinical judgment is 
required.20, 38, 60, 72, 88, 115, 162, 172, 174
Epidemiological studies have generally identified motor 
vehicle accidents, falls and assaults as the commonest 
causes of head injuries. In studies on patients with mild 
head injuries, specific high risk factors for intracranial injury 
that have been identified include focal blunt trauma to the 
head,38, 60, 72, 88, 115 pedestrians or cyclists struck by motor 
vehicles,20, 60, 88, 172, 174 ejection from motor vehicle,172, 174 
and falls with variable heights specified.38, 172, 174
Multi-system trauma
In mild head injury patients with multi-system 
trauma, clinical judgement is required regarding the 
need for CT scanning, particularly in the presence of 
unstable vital signs or associated injuries requiring 
significant amounts of analgesia, procedural sedation 
or general anaesthesia.162, 172, 174 
Most guidelines and studies on mild head injury have 
specifically excluded patients with multi-system trauma 
or unstable vital signs.162, 172, 174 It is therefore difficult 
to make evidence based recommendations and clinical 
judgment is required. A low threshold for performing head 
CT scan in multi-system trauma patients should be used as 
subtle neurological signs are easily missed in the presence 
of distracting injuries. Similarly, clinicians should have a
