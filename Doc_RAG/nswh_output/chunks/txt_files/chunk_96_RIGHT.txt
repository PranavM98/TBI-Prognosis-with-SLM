summarised in the list below. The GCS can be said to…
- Aid in clinical decision making in interventions such as 
airway management or intensive care admission
- Describe, quantitate and add structure to the 
assessment of coma
- Facilitate and standardise communication between 
clinicians
- Enable monitoring of change in both component 
and overall scores, i.e. trends in the early stages after 
injury, allowing rapid detection of complications and 
discriminating between those at higher or lower risk of 
complications
- Be an indicator of the severity of illness
- Facilitate comparison between groups of patients
- Allow triage of patients after injury
- Provide a tool for prognostication
- Allow standardisation of patients and patient groups 
for research
The important primary uses for the GCS can be distilled 
from this list to…
- Act as an indicator of the level injury and illness, 
allowing triage and immediate intervention when 
required, as well as to enable monitoring by the 
provision of valid measurements and trends of level of 
consciousness
- Facilitate understanding, clear description and 
communication between clinicians. This should enable 
one clinician to describe the level of consciousness to 
another, whether face-to-face or remotely, in the sure 
knowledge that this description precisely represents 
the injury, physiological and functional state of the 
patient and that the receiving clinician may accurately 
comprehend this from the description.
