significantly there have been very few large prospective 
randomised controlled trials of sufficient power and quality 
to guide management.11, 13, 14 However, in the past few 
years there has been some progress in working toward 
uniform definitions and some better quality trials and metaanalyses have been published.6, 8-10, 15-35 
The variety of clinical practice observed worldwide 
cannot be explained solely by the lack of uniformity of 
definitions and good quality studies. Much of the variation 
in management strategies between the USA, Canada, 
Europe and Australasia is driven by local issues such as 
the availability of resources, the medico-legal environment 
and in recent years the concerns about the potential harm 
from CT radiation.6, 36, 37 Thus the USA has higher rates of 
CT scanning for mild head injuries compared to Canada, 
Europe and the UK. Even within countries and within 
institutions, considerable variation in practice has been 
shown to exist.7, 12, 35, 38 Whilst some variation in clinical 
practice is to be expected, the introduction of clinical 
practice guidelines can potentially improve care and ensure 
adequate access to resources for more isolated areas.6, 35 
Furthermore, clinical guidelines can potentially reduce 
unnecessary tests and hospital admissions for mild head 
injury patients by identifying those patients at low risk of 
neurosurgically significant lesions.6, 13, 33-35 
Scope of the guideline
The guideline is intended for use by clinicians managing 
patients with closed head injury in major and regional 
trauma services, and urban and rural hospitals. The 
guideline is concerned with the initial care of the mild, 
moderate and severely head injured patient. The guideline 
will make evidence based recommendations on the 
diagnosis, resuscitation, and disposal of patients with closed 
head injuries.
