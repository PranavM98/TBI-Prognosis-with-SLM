The GCS is NOT a scale to measure an altered sensorium, 
so cannot be used to test sensation. It is also not substitute 
for either a full neurological examination or an assessment 
of orientation.193, 197 It also does not account for true 
lateralisation as it measures the best response rather than 
the worst.193
The sternal rub has been documented to cause injury, 
particularly pressure area damage204 and cannot be 
recommended. Supraorbital nerve pressure has caused 
damage and is less reliable and consistent than other 
methods or applying a central noxious stimulus.205 The 
trapezius pinch causes no damage as it simply comprises 
pressure on a large muscular area, but does provide a 
suitable painful stimulus.204 Ensure that you note whether 
the upper limb localised to the painful stimulus by crossing 
the midline or not; if it does not, carefully assess to 
discriminate between this and abnormal flexion.
