- Neurosurgical intervention rare (1-3%)
- Abnormality on CT scan relatively uncommon (5-15%)

- Non-traumatic brain injury.
Risk Stratiﬁ cation
Patients may be classiﬁ ed into “high” and “low” risk groups based on the risk of suffering complications 
of their mild head injury. This risk stratiﬁ cation can be used to assist clinical judgement in determining 
the need for further assessment (eg CT scan), management and follow up. Stratiﬁ cation into “high” and 
“low” risk groups is based on the presence or absence of speciﬁ ed clinical risk factors identiﬁ ed by:
- initial clinical history
- initial clinical examination
- serial clinical observation
“Complicated” Mild Head Injury
A “complicated” mild head injury is a mild head injury resulting in one of the following:
- signiﬁ cant structural lesion on CT scan
- signiﬁ cant acute clinical symptoms
- signiﬁ cant post concussion symptoms
