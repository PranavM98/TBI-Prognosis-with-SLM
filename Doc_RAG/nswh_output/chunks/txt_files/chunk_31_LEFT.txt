Mild head injury patients (initial GCS 14-15) require a CT 
scan if they are clinically assessed as being at significant risk 
of acute deterioration from an underlying intracranial injury. 
The WHO Taskforce on MTBI (Borg et al 2004101) concluded 
that on the basis of their meta-analysis that “there is 
strong evidence that clinical factors can predict CT scan 
abnormalities and the need for (neurosurgical) intervention 
in adults.” There have been many recent studies looking at 
which risk factors predict intracranial injury and the need 
for CT scan and a variety of clinical decision rules have 
been developed. These studies are mostly based on large 
prospectively collected data bases in the USA, Canada, and 
Europe although their findings have been reproduced in 
smaller studies throughout the world. Haydel et al32 (2000 
– New Orleans Criteria), Stiell et al35 (2001 – Canadian CT 
Head Rules), Mower et al58 (2005 – NEXUS II) and Smits 
et al47 (2007 – CHIP Rule) have all derived clinical decision 
rules with slightly varying inclusion and exclusion criteria 
and identified risk factors. Ibanez et al33 (2004), Fabbri et 
al125 (2004) and Stein et al48 (2009) have also done large 
studies looking at clinical risk factors and assessing the 
validity of the various clinical decision rules and guidelines 
while Rosengren et al118 (2004) and Fong et al57 (2008) have 
performed similar smaller studies on Australian populations. 
Ono et al137 (2007), Turedi et al81 (2008) and Saboori et 
al80 (2007) have published recent studies on Japanese, 
Turkish and Iranian populations. Kuppermam et al85 (2009) 
and Dunning et al138 (2006) have recently published large 
studies in the paediatric population in which they identified 
clinical risk factors and developed clinical decision rules 
that are similar to those developed for adults. There is now 
a large body of evidence suggesting that mild head injury 
patients can be risk stratified based on clinical assessment. 
The clinical risk factors that indicate patients are at 
increased risk of intracranial injury are discussed in the 
following text, and most of the relevant studies summarised 
in the evidentiary tables. 
Mild head injury patients can be risk stratified into “low” 
or “high” risk groups based on the presence or absence 
of identified clinical risk factors. The absence of clinical 
risk factors on initial assessment combined with a period 
of observation during which the patient clinically improves 
makes the probability of a significant intracranial injury 
extremely unlikely. These low risk mild head injury patients 
can be discharged for home observation without CT 
scanning. Among the patients with identified risk factors, 
there are those who clearly require CT scanning and those 
in whom clinical judgement may be required. In the high 
risk group, which includes initially low risk patients who
