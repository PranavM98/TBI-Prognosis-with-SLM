department, eg Abbreviated Westmead PTA Scale 
(A-WPTAS) can be useful in identifying patients with 
cognitive impairment at increased risk of structural 
lesions and post concussion symptoms.
Indications for CT scan for mild head injury
- Recent literature emphasises that patients can be risk 
stratified according to clinical risk factors and clinical 
decision rules. Patients who are classified as high risk 
should have CT scans to exclude clinically important 
intracranial lesions
- Significant head injuries can occur without loss of 
consciousness or amnesia and that the absence of 
these features should not be used to determine the 
need for CT scanning.
- Persistent abnormal mental status manifested by either 
abnormal GCS or abnormal alertness, behaviour or 
cognition is a strong indication for CT scanning 
- Known coagulopathy and particularly supratherapeutic anticoagulation are significant risk factors 
for intracranial injury and that these patients should 
have early CT scans and be considered for reversal of 
anticoagulation
- There have been several very large studies addressing 
this issue in the paediatric literature that have come up 
with very similar risk factors to the adult literature and 
have also confirmed that it is safe to discharge low risk 
patients without CT scanning.
Acute neurological deterioration
- Recommendations essentially unchanged
- Previously covered within guideline but now given 
separate question
 Discharge of patients with mild head injury
- Recent literature emphasises that patients can be safely 
discharged for home observation if structured clinical 
assessment reveals no clinical risk factors indicating the 
need for CT scanning or following a normal CT scan if 
indicated.
- Deterioration of mild head injury patients following 
a normal CT scan is rare. Caution is advised for 
patients with known coagulopathy and elderly patients 
where the risk of a delayed subdural haemorrhage is 
increased.
