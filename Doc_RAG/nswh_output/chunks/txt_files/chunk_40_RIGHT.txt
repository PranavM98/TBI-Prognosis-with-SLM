drowsiness, vomiting or severe headache were potential 
early signs of deterioration in this group.
Once a mild head injury patient deteriorates then the 
priorities are exclusion of other injuries, supportive care of 
the ABCDEs and early CT scan to identify a neurosurgically 
significant lesion. If a neurosurgically significant lesion 
is identified, further management should be discussed 
with a neurosurgical service including measures to reduce 
intracranial pressure and prevent seizures.
There is good evidence to support the systematic 
resuscitation of ABCDEs with prevention of hypoxia and 
hypotension and the early identification and decompression 
of acute neurosurgical lesions.25,103 There is some evidence 
to support short-term hyperventilation and mannitol while 
awaiting definitive surgery.2, 23, 102, 144, 188 There is some 
evidence to support the prophylactic use of anticonvulsants 
to prevent early seizures.2, 23, 102, 151
