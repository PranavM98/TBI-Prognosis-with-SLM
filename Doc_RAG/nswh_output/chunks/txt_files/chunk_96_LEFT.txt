Appendix 5: The Glasgow Coma Scale - a practical implementation guide
Associate Professor Paul M Middleton
Introduction
Impairment of consciousness is one of the most consistent 
features of head injury, and the Glasgow Coma Scale 
(GCS) was described by Teasdale and Jennett in 1974192, 
based on a theoretical model of level of consciousness. 
It was introduced as a simple tool, not to allow absolute 
distinctions between levels of consciousness, but to be an 
effective method of accurately describing the various states 
of impairment within the continuum of consciousness.192 
As the authors stated in the original paper “In the acute 
stage, changes in conscious level provide the best indication 
of the development of complications such as intracranial 
haematoma, whilst the depth of coma and its duration 
indicate the degree of ultimate recovery which can be 
expected”. Prior to this most descriptions of altered 
levels of consciousness revolved around very subjective 
portrayals such as “comatose”, “drowsy”, “obtunded”, and 
“stuporose”.193
The GCS was originally described by the authors as a 
repeated bedside assessment of the “…depth and duration 
of impaired consciousness and coma”192, and was used to 
objectively determine the severity of coma and underlying 
brain dysfunction at six hours following head trauma. This 
time frame was chosen to avoid overestimation of brain 
damage produced by temporary factors such as alcohol, 
hypoxia or hypotension,193 and similarly the GCS should be 
recorded prior to any sedation.
The GCS has also been incorporated as the neurological 
component of assessment into various aggregate scores 
such as APACHE and TRISS,193 and it has been found that 
taking out this neurological component worsened predictive 
ability, which led to the presumption that neurological 
status is the best predictor of overall functional outcome.194 
The GCS makes up 17% of the theoretical maximum Acute 
Physiology Score (APS) in APACHE II, 19% of the APS in 
APACHE III195 and is the basis of the World Federation of 
neurosurgeons (WFNS) subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) 
grading scale.196 
The GCS, in actual fact, has evolved through both design 
and common usage to fulfil multiple functions, which are
