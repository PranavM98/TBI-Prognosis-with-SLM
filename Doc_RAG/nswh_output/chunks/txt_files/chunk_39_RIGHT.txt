It is reasonable to admit some mild head injury patients to 
hospital for serial observation if CT scan is unavailable and 
urgent transfer to neurosurgical care impractical. Prior to 
the widespread availability of CT scanning, admission for 
serial assessment of GCS was the standard treatment for 
patients with head injury. Borg et al101 (2004 diagnostic 
procedures), in a meta analysis for the World Health 
Organisation on mild traumatic brain injury, concluded that 
in the absence of CT scanning, that hospital observation for 
at least 24 hours for patients with GCS 15 and other risk 
factors was a reasonable strategy. Similarly, af Geijerstam et 
al91 found in a large population based study on mild head 
injury patients with GCS 15 that the outcome for a serial 
observation in hospital strategy was similar to the outcome 
for an immediate CT strategy at 3 month follow up. This 
presumed that appropriate care could be delivered in the 
event of deterioration. Clinical judgement is clearly required 
where patients have GCS 15 but clinical symptoms that 
fail to improve with observation. The primary advantage 
of performing an early CT scan is to be able to safely 
discharge a patient if the CT scan is normal. Thus, when 
CT is unavailable, serial clinical observation is a reasonable 
strategy for mild head injury patients with GCS 15 as long 
as patients can be transferred to neurosurgical care in a 
timely fashion in case of deterioration.
