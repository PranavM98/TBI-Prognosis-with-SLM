Loss of consciousness increases the risk of intracranial injury 
and is used by many authorities to define mild head injury 
(Evidence Table 1). However, the absolute risk associated 
with loss of consciousness is small.6, 74
The absence of loss of consciousness or amnesia has been 
used to classify patients as ‘minimal risk’.6, 8-10 However, 
more recent studies have shown that the absence of loss of 
consciousness does not rule out intracranial lesions in either 
adults or children.9, 33, 34, 47, 54, 57-59, 65, 85 Similarly, adult 
studies have shown that transient LOC does not accurately 
predict the risk of intracranial injury.33, 61, 67, 73, 141, 142
Duration of loss of consciousness is also controversial. 
‘Brief’ loss of consciousness in mild head injury patients is 
usually associated with good functional outcome while a 
specific time for ‘prolonged’ loss of consciousness is not 
clearly associated with poorer outcome.10, 63, 72, 74 The 
exact definitions of what should be considered a low-risk 
duration vary greatly from momentary to five minutes, 
to 20 minutes to 30 minutes.6, 8-10 In the NEXUS II study, 
prolonged loss of consciousness > 5 minutes was found to 
increase risk of intracranial injury but was not a sufficiently 
useful discriminator to include in their clinical decision 
rule derivation.58 The clinical recommendation of the 
neurosurgical committee of the Royal Australasian College 
of Surgeons (RACS) is that loss of consciousness should be 
considered brief if less than five minutes.1
From a practical viewpoint, obtaining a definite history and 
duration of loss of consciousness is often difficult.47, 143 In a 
recent review, Ruff et al143 detailed the difficulties in getting 
a reliable history of loss of consciousness. Head injuries are 
frequently unwitnessed, observers unreliable and patients 
often affected by alcohol or post traumatic amnesia. It is 
perhaps simplest to consider loss of consciousness in terms 
of no loss of consciousness, brief loss of consciousness 
less than five minutes or prolonged loss of consciousness 
greater than five minutes. Most patients with a witnessed 
prolonged loss of consciousness are likely to have other 
indications for CT scan but in the unlikely event that none 
were present then a CT scan should be performed.
Post traumatic amnesia
Persistent post traumatic amnesia is a strong 
indication for CT scanning. Amnesia for the event 
does not warrant CT scanning.31, 32, 35, 47, 56, 74
