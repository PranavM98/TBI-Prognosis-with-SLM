procedural sedation or general anaesthesia for 
associated injuries.
- Appropriate pain relief should not be withheld due to 
concerns of masking head injury symptoms and signs 
as the patients pain is likely to make clinical assessment 
more difficult and mask other signs of injury and the 
patient should not be allowed to suffer unnecessarily.
Moderate to severe head injury
- Isolated moderate head injury patients who rapidly 
clinically improve can be treated in a similar way to 
mild head injury patients. They all require an initial CT 
- However, most moderate head injury patients and 
nearly all severe head injury patients will require 
titrated intravenous analgesia and sedation for 
associated injuries, clinical management or intubation. 
These patients will all require close clinical observation 
in a high dependency area following initial clinical 
assessment and CT scanning. Analgesia needs to be 
individualised under the supervision of senior clinicians.
- Routine analgesia with intravenous opioids is 
recommended for most intubated patients as pain 
may cause adverse effects on blood pressure and 
intracranial pressure.
