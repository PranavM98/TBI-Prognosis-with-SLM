Note 
The presence of multiple risk factors is more concerning than a single isolated risk 
factor. In most uncomplicated mild head injury patients clinical symptoms start to 
improve by 2 hours post injury and are returning to normal by 4 hours post injury. 
Clinical symptoms that are deteriorating or not improving by 4 hours post injury on 
serial observation such as abnormal alertness / behaviour / cognition, PTA, vomiting or 
severe headache are very concerning.
Abnormal CT scan
CT scan unavailable
Consider transfer for CT scanning particularly if:
- Persistent GCS <15.
- Deterioration in GCS.
- Focal neurological deficit.
- Clinical suspicion of skull fracture 
- Known coagulopathy (esp if INR>4)
-  Persistent abnormal alertness, behaviour, cognition, 
PTA, vomiting or severe headache at 4 hours post injury
Consult senior clinician and network neurosurgical service 
regarding further management and disposition. 
Continue clinical observations in hospital.
Explanatory notes for risk factors
1.  Using GCS<15 at 2 hours post injury allows clinical judgement for patients who present soon after 
injury or who have drug or alcohol intoxication. Drug or alcohol intoxication has not been shown to 
be an independant risk factor for intracranial injury but persistent GCS<15 is a major risk factor and 
mandates CT. 
2.  Clinical suspicion of skull fracture includes history of focal blunt assault or injury; palpable skull fracture; 
large scalp haematoma or laceration; signs of base of skull fracture – haemotympanum / CSF leak / 
raccoon eyes / Battles sign.
3.  Recurrent vomiting more concerning than isolated vomiting but both are indications.
4.  Known coagulopathy is both a strong indication for early CT scan and to check the INR. Early reversal of 
anticoagulation if abnormal CT scan and consider reversal if initially normal CT scan with high INR (>4) 
depending on clinical situation.
5.  Elderly patients have increasing risk of intracranial injury with increasing age; routine CT scanning 
indicated unless totally asymptomatic patient with no other risk factors.
6.  Brief generalised seizures immediately following head injury are not significant risk factors. Prolonged, 
focal or delayed seizures are risk factors for intracranial injury.
7.  Post traumatic amnesia may manifest as repetitive questioning or short term memory deficits and can 
be objectively tested using the A-WPTAS. PTA > 30 mins is a minor risk factor and PTA > 4 hours a 
major risk factor for intracranial injury.
8.  Abnormal alertness/behaviour/cognition detects subtle brain injury better than GCS and should be part 
of the bedside assessment. Family may help establish what is normal.
9.  Multi-system trauma – beware patient with unstable vital signs or distracting injuries or who receive 
analgesia or anaesthesia, as significant head injury is easily missed.
10. Clinical judgement required as to what is a large scalp haematoma or laceration.
11.  Dangerous - MVA ejection / rollover; pedestrians / cyclists hit by vehicle; falls >own height or five stairs; 
falls from horses / cycles etc; focal blunt trauma, eg bat / ball / club.
12.  Known neurosurgery/neurological impairment – conditions such as hydrocephalus with shunt or AVM 
or tumour or cognitive impairment such as dementia make clinical assessment less reliable and may 
increase risk of intracranial injury.
13.  Delayed presentation should be considered as failure to clinically improve during observation. For 
representation consider both intracranial injury and post concussion symptoms and have a low 
threshold for CT scanning if not done initially.
