'High risk’ mild head injury requiring CT scan
The following risk factors identify patients with mild head injury (initial GCS 14-15) at increased 
risk of clinically signiﬁ cant lesions requiring acute neurosurgical intervention or prolonged 
observation in hospital. These patients should have early CT scanning if available, if they have any 
of the following features:
On initial assessment
- GCS<15 at two hours post injury**
- Focal neurological deﬁ cit
- Clinical suspicion of skull fracture
- Vomiting 
- Known coagulopathy or bleeding disorder
- Age >65 
- Witnessed seizure
- Prolonged loss of consciousness (>5min)
On serial assessment
- Decrease in GCS
- Persistent GCS<15 at two hours post injury
- Persistent abnormal alertness/behaviour/cognition
- Persistent post traumatic amnesia (A-WPTAS<18/18 at 4hrs post injury)
- Persistent vomiting ( 2 occasions)
- Persistent severe headache
- Post traumatic seizure 
Clinical judgement required if
- Initial GCS 14 within two hours of injury** 
- Large scalp haematoma or laceration
- Associated multi-system injuries
- Dangerous mechanism
- Known neurosurgery/neurological impairment
- Delayed presentation or representation
** NOTE: Includes patients with abnormal GCS due to drug or alcohol ingestion.
If CT scanning is unavailable
“High risk” mild head injury patients should be closely observed and be considered for transfer to a 
hospital with neurosurgical and CT scan facilities when CT scan is unavailable.
A clear decision about the need for transfer for CT scanning for “high risk” patients should be made 
at the time of initial assessment or after a brief period of observation. A local senior clinician should be 
consulted and the patient discussed with the network neurosurgical service.
The clinical symptoms of patients with mild head injury typically improve within two to four hours post 
time of injury. Patients with persistently abnormal or worsening clinical symptoms are at “high risk” of 
intracranial injury. A clear decision about the need for transfer for CT scanning should be made no later 
than 4 hours post time of injury.
