Patients with closed head injury should be observed in 
facilities that can manage any complications that are likely 
to arise. Clinical judgment regarding risk of deterioration is 
required and early neurosurgical consultation is advisable.
Patients with closed head injury assessed at hospitals 
without CT scanning facilities should be transferred to the 
nearest appropriate hospital if there is significant risk of 
intracranial injury. Transfer of patients to a hospital with CT 
scanning facilities but without neurosurgical services should 
be avoided wherever possible. 
Fabbri et al41 recently published a study in which they 
compared the outcome for mild to moderate head injury 
patients and initial non-neurosurgical lesions on CT scan 
when managed in neurosurgical units versus peripheral 
hospitals. Their system allowed for rapid transfer of patients 
to the tertiary centre in the event of deterioration and used 
a teleradiology link to review CT scans. The outcome for 
patients was not shown to be significantly different. Huynh 
et al168 also showed in a retrospective study that trauma 
patients with GCS 15 and an abnormal CT scan could be 
safely managed without neurosurgical consultation. Both 
these studies would support the current NSW practice of 
managing some head injury patients in non-neurosurgical 
centres following consultation with a network neurosurgical 
centre.
