The broad objectives of the guideline are to reduce 
morbidity and mortality in adult patients with closed head 
injury by providing clinicians with practical evidence based 
recommendations to assist them in managing such patients. 
It is also hoped that the guidelines may prevent unnecessary 
diagnostic tests and hospital admissions especially in the 
mild head injury group. 
The process of constructing the guideline began 
with the clinicians on the Trauma Clinical Guidelines 
Committee posing a series of questions about the initial 
management of closed head injuries. The final questions 
were derived from the guideline priority areas identified 
by the committee; that is, the management of mild head 
injuries and the timing of transfer of patients with closed 
head injury from centres with limited resources. The 
initial management of patients with moderate to severe 
head injury was felt to be less controversial. This edition 
also includes recommendations in relation to the use of 
analgesia and anti-convulsants.
An extensive description of the methodology used for this 
guideline can be found at Appendix 8, together with the
