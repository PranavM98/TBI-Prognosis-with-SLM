evolutionary rather than revolutionary. The basic principles 
of management of closed head injury remain the same in 
2010 as they were five years ago. 
The following section briefly outlines the most significant 
advances in knowledge from the recent literature 
incorporated in this update. 
Definition of mild head injury
- Recent literature emphasises that significant intracranial 
injury may occur without loss of consciousness or 
amnesia
- Patients with initial GCS 13 have a significantly higher 
rate of intracranial injury and should not be considered 
as having mild head injury
Clinically important complications of mild head injury
- Recent literature emphasises that mild post concussion 
symptoms are common and that patients should 
receive appropriate discharge advice to assist recovery
- Acute neurosurgical complications are uncommon but 
important to identify
Assessment of patients with mild head injury
- Recent literature emphasises that if structured clinical 
assessment indicates the risk of intracranial injury is 
low, the routine use of CT scanning is not warranted 
and is potentially harmful.
- Structured clinical assessment should include initial 
clinical history and examination, serial clinical 
observations and clinical risk factor assessment to 
determine the need for CT scanning
- A variety of clinical decision rules have been developed 
to determine which patients are at higher risk of 
intracranial injury and require CT scanning. However, 
they all require that the clinician is familiar with their 
inclusion / exclusion criteria and should be used as 
tools to support clinical decision making, rather than 
dictate management
