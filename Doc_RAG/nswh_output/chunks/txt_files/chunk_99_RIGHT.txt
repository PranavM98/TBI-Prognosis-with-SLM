Motor
Motor component scores of 6, 5 and 4 imply the presence 
of a degree of cerebral function and thus the ability 
to react appropriately to a noxious stimulus. Obeys 
commands indicates an ability to process and obey verbal 
commands;197 localisation means that the patient is able 
to identify the location of a painful stimulus and attempt 
to remove it, an action often accompanied by the upper 
extremity of a patient purposefully crossing the midline 
to remove the stimulus193, 197. Withdrawal means that 
the patient is attempting to move away from the noxious 
stimulus, sometimes by adopting a fetal position.197 This 
last position is particularly important when there is an 
inexperienced observer, as differentiating a localising 
response from an abnormal flexion response may prove 
difficult.195
A motor component score of 3, or an abnormal flexor 
response, implies that the lesion is located in the cerebral 
hemispheres or internal capsule,193 whereas a score of 
2 describes a midbrain to upper pontine damage.193 
Abnormal flexor response is complex, but involves 
adduction of upper limbs, with flexion of arms, wrists 
and fingers. Accompanying this are extension and 
internal rotation of lower limbs, and plantar flexion of 
feet. This must be differentiated from the normal flexor 
response or withdrawal, but also from extensor posturing 
which indicates a lesion lower in the central nervous 
system, and therefore reflecting CNS function at a lower 
level.193 Extensor posturing includes the same lower limb 
appearances as in abnormal flexion, but with the upper 
limbs adopting a different position; this is described as 
extension of the upper limbs along the sides of the body, 
accompanied by pronation of the forearms. Abnormal 
flexion and extensor posturing are often known by the 
terms decerebrate and decorticate response, implying the 
level of loss of CNS function, and studies have shown that 
patients showing extensor posturing are more likely to 
have a poor outcome than those with abnormal flexion.197 
If a patient demonstrates flexion on one side of the body, 
and extension on the other, the best of the two responses 
needs to be recorded.193
None means that the patient is flaccid, and does not make 
any movement in response to a painful stimulus. In these 
circumstances, it is essential to check that the patient is 
not pharmacologically or pathologically paralysed. Bear in 
mind again, that as the GCS is endeavouring to measure 
cognition and that abnormal motor responses, due to 
the presence of anaesthetic paralysis or spinal cord injury
