situation where multiple post concussion symptoms persist 
for several months they are called a “post concussion 
syndrome”
As this guideline concentrates on the initial management 
of the patients presenting to hospital, it was felt that the 
term ‘head injury’ was more relevant to the initial clinical 
presentation than the term ‘traumatic brain injury’ that 
essentially refers to the subsequent functional outcome. It 
was also felt that the clinicians at whom this guideline is 
aimed would be far more familiar and comfortable with 
using the term ‘head injury.’ The definition of closed head 
injury is further discussed in Question 1.
Classification of closed head injury
This guideline has classified patients with initial GCS 14-15 
on admission as mild head injury. This system classifies 
patients with initial GCS score of 13 in the moderate head 
injury group due to the patients having similarly patterns of 
intracranial injury and cognitive behavioural sequelae. The 
following table gives a rough guide to classification and 
outcome.15, 39-43
