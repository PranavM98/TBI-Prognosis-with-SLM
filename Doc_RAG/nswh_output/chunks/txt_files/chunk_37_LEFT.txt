scalp haematoma is included in most clinical decision rules 
particularly among young children.14, 49, 94, 123, 130, 174 There 
is no clear guidance in the literature as to what should be 
considered a significant scalp haematoma or laceration 
other than a trend to “large’ and “non frontal”. There is 
no evidence for the use of descriptors such as “boggy” or 
“tense” to help discriminate between significant and non 
significant haematomas.
Drug or alcohol intoxication
Drug or alcohol ingestion with a normal mental state 
is not an indication for CT scanning. Drug or alcohol 
intoxication resulting in an abnormal mental state is 
an indication for CT scanning.22, 38, 40, 53, 74, 85, 115, 162, 
168, 172, 174 
Drug or alcohol intoxication is frequently present in patients 
with head injury and makes patients difficult to assess and 
manage. Cook et al,60 in a study of alcohol intoxicated 
patients, found that clinical examination could not predict 
which alcohol intoxicated patients had abnormal CT scans. 
However, they observed that the rate of abnormal CT scan 
and neurosurgical intervention was similar to that of the 
non-intoxicated mild head injury population. Several studies 
have suggested that drug or alcohol intoxication is a risk 
factor for intracranial injury but the exact definition of 
intoxication remains vague.31, 32
Since 2004 there have been several large well designed 
studies and clinical decision rules published that have found 
that alcohol is not an independent risk factor for intracranial 
injury in patients with mild head injury.22, 38, 85, 115, 162, 168, 
172 Bracken et al153 looked at the intoxicated patients (3356 
patients) in the NEXUS II database who had received CT 
scans and found that the rate of intracranial injury was 
lower than the non-intoxicated group. Although it would 
appear that alcohol intoxication is not an independent 
risk factor for intracranial injury it remains a common 
clinical dilemma to decide what to do with a head injured 
patient with an abnormal mental status when it is not clear 
whether it is the alcohol or the head injury that is causing 
the abnormality.
Stiell et al35 took a slightly different approach and used GCS 
<15 at two hours post injury as their variable to predict 
abnormal mental status for whatever reason. They argued 
that drug or alcohol intoxication was not an independent 
predictor of intracranial injury if the patient had a normal
