Recent exhaustive reviews by the Brain Trauma Foundation15 
and the Cochrane Review Group16-30 have looked at the 
management of severe head injuries. The findings of 
these detailed reviews are summarised in Evidence Table 
4. This guideline summarises the generally accepted initial 
management steps for severe head injury including those 
recommended by the current Advanced Trauma Life 
Support course and the Brain Trauma Foundation.15, 40 The 
network neurosurgical service should be consulted about 
further management of patients with severe head injury 
as soon as practical after the initial primary survey and 
resuscitation is completed. 
It is important to recognise that for the majority of severe 
head injury patients the most important aspect of care is 
systematic resuscitation of the ABCDEs with prevention 
of secondary brain injury as per current ATLS guidelines.40 
Resuscitation of the ABCDEs with adequate oxygenation 
and fluid resuscitation and the treatment of other 
immediately life threatening injuries should be the priority 
for patients with severe head injury followed by the CT 
identification of focal intracranial lesions requiring acute 
neurosurgical intervention.40, 157 Early intubation to prevent 
hypoxaemia and facilitate management is recommended.40 
Hyperventilation should be avoided and patients should 
normally be ventilated to maintain normocarbia.24, 158 Fluid 
resuscitation with normal saline or Hartmanns followed 
by blood products to maintain normovolaemia and mean 
arterial pressure is recommended.157 Anticonvulsants are 
usually recommended to prevent early post traumatic 
seizures particularly if there is an abnormal CT scan or 
a history of a witnessed seizure.17, 29, 151 Blood glucose 
and temperature should be monitored and maintained 
in a normal range.159, 160 Thus, good supportive care 
of the ABCDEs, with the prevention of hypoxaemia 
and hypotension, remain the cornerstone of initial 
management.40
The network neurological service should be urgently 
consulted about any patient with an acute neurological 
deterioration suggestive of acutely raised intracranial 
pressure. In the event of acute deterioration, it is important 
to remember that hyperventilation24, 158 and intravenous 
mannitol boluses161,162 are short-term measures to reduce 
intracranial pressure whilst the patient is urgently assessed 
for the need for acute neurosurgical intervention. If an 
acutely deteriorating patient with a proven extradural 
or subdural haematoma cannot be transferred to a 
neurosurgical service within two hours, then the option of 
local surgical decompression should be discussed with the 
neurosurgical service.
