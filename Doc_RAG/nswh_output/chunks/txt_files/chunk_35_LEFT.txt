include it in their clinical decision rules. Mower et al58 
found that severe headache was a risk factor but did not 
include it in their clinical decision rule. Interestingly, in a 
later study, Clement et al77 found that severe headache was 
a significant risk factor for those patients with GCS 15 who 
required neurosurgical intervention. 
The general trend of the literature would suggest that mild 
headache is not a significant concern but persistent severe 
headache should be considered a significant risk factor for 
intracranial injury.
Coagulopathy or bleeding disorder
Known coagulopathy or bleeding disorder is both 
a strong indication for early CT scan and also an 
indication to check the INR and to consider reversal 
of anticoagulation. Anticoagulated patients with any 
evidence of haemorrhage on CT scan should have 
early rapid reversal of anticoagulation. Patients with 
a supra-therapeutic INR (>4) should be considered 
for either partial or full reversal and admitted to 
hospital for prolonged observation. Prolonged 
observation and follow up repeat CT scan should 
be considered for any anticoagulated patients or 
patients with bleeding disorders.39, 42, 53, 54, 63, 74, 
85-87, 110, 115, 153, 162, 172, 174, 187
Most guidelines and studies on mild head injury mention 
coagulopathy or bleeding disorder either as a significant 
risk factor or an exclusion criteria in the assessment of 
risk of intracranial injury.42, 53, 74, 85, 87, 115, 153, 162, 172, 
174, 187 However, there was no compelling evidence to 
either support or refute this reasonable assertion in 
the mild head injury patient group until recently. Mina 
et al147 demonstrated that pre-existing anticoagulation 
significantly increased the risk of death from intracranial 
injury in trauma patients with head injury. However, this 
was a heterogenous patient group with significantly 
abnormal ISS (mean 17.0 +/- 7.8) and GCS (mean 11.8 
+/- 4.0). Subsequent small studies by Franko et al,78 Ivascu 
et al,79 Cohen et al,148 Fabbri et al41 and Allard et al149 
have all demonstrated significant risk of both intracranial 
haemorrhage and mortality in anti-coagulated head injury 
patients. Cohen et al148 and Ivascu et al79 both found that 
patients with mild head injury were at significant risk of 
intracranial injury and acute deterioration particularly if 
they had an increased INR. An initial normal CT scan did 
not exclude the possibility of deterioration. Franko et al78
