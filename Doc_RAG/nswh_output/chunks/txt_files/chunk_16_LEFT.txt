What are the clinically important complications of mild head injury?
RECOMMENDATION
Strength of 
recommendation
The clinically important complications of mild head injury are:
- structural lesions on CT scan requiring acute neurosurgical intervention
- structural lesions on CT scan requiring hospital admission and/or neurosurgical consultation
- acute clinical symptoms requiring acute hospital admission
- post concussion symptoms causing disabling cognitive behavioural social sequelae
Structural lesions on CT scan requiring acute neurosurgical intervention are rare (1-3%).
Typical lesions include:
- acute extradural haematoma
- acute subdural haematoma
- depressed skull fractures
Structural lesions on CT scan requiring hospital admission and/or neurosurgical consultation are relatively 
uncommon (5-15%). Not all of these lesions will require hospital admission.
Typical lesions include:
- small intracranial haematomas/haemorrhages
- minor skull fractures
Clinicians and patients should be aware that the absence of a structural lesion on CT scan following 
mild head injury does not exclude the possibility of signiﬁ cant acute clinical symptoms or signiﬁ cant post 
concussion symptoms.
Acute clinical symptoms are common immediately following mild head injury but should be starting to 
improve in most patients within two to four hours of time of injury.
Common acute clinical symptoms include:
- post traumatic amnesia
- disorientation
- confusion
- drowsiness
- dizziness
- nausea
- vomiting
- headache
Patients with persistent acute clinical symptoms at four hours post time of injury require prolonged 
clinical observation and a CT scan should be performed (if not already done) to exclude a structural 
lesion. 
Patients with persistent post traumatic amnesia and/or other persistent signiﬁ cant acute clinical 
symptoms that are not improving require prolonged clinical observation and should be admitted to 
hospital even if their initial CT scan is normal.
