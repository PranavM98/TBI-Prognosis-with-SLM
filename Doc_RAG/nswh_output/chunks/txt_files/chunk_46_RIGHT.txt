If the referring clinician is unsure about the need for a 
particular therapy, such as prophylactic anticonvulsants 
or antibiotics, then the network neurosurgical service 
should be consulted. There are many other promising 
areas of treatment such as induced hypothermia159, 160 
and hypertonic saline.161 However, there is currently 
insufficient evidence to recommend these as first line 
therapy. Corticosteroids have been shown to worsen the 
patient outcome and are not recommended for the initial 
management of closed head injury.163, 164
Detailed evaluation of subsequent management of severe 
head injuries by the neurosurgical services are beyond the 
scope of these guidelines. There is limited high quality 
evidence to guide management and the relative merits 
of different strategies are hotly debated in the literature. 
The Brain Trauma Foundation review, the Cochrane Group 
reviews, the BMJ Clinical Evidence review165 and recent 
Australian reviews2, 117 all agree that there is no class 1 
evidence to guide management of severe head injury 
patients. However, there is broad consensus agreement 
that strategies to control cerebral perfusion using ICP 
monitoring,27, 28, 61 mild hypothermia26, 66, 135 and 
decompressive craniectomy166 are promising strategies that 
are being widely used and require further study.
Predicting outcome following closed head injury is difficult. 
There have been many attempts to provide scoring 
systems to predict outcome with one of the best known 
being that provided by the CRASH Investigators167. It 
is perhaps prudent to err on the side of caution in the 
initial management setting as at least 24-48 hours of 
investigation and management are required before offering 
any sort of prognosis.
