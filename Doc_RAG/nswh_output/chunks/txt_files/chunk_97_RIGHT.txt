integration within the nervous system and the presence 
of speech represents a high degree of this integration.193 
The motor response is considered a good indicator of the 
ability of the nervous system to function properly due to 
the variety of possible motion patterns192, 193 and is also 
considered to represent that part of the central nervous 
system least affected by trauma.193 Total GCS up to 8 
largely reflects changes in motor response, referring to 
patients with no eye opening or verbal response; response 
scores from 9-15 depend more on eye opening and verbal 
response.198 Changes in the eye and verbal responses, 
and thus higher overall scores, are useful in discriminating 
between patients with less severe impairment of 
consciousness. One research group found that increasing 
scores in the 9-15 range (reflecting improving eye and 
verbal performances) are associated with a doubling of the 
rate of good recovery in survivors of head injury.199
