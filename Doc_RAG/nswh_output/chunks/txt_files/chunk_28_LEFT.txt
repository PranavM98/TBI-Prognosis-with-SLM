Timing of CT scanning
There is no direct evidence to confirm what the best time 
to perform CT scanning in relation to time of injury is. The 
primary role of early CT scanning in mild head injury is early 
recognition of extradural or subdural haematomas prior 
to clinical deterioration.69 Early neurosurgical intervention 
prior to clinical deterioration is associated with improved 
outcome. However, early CT scan may potentially miss other 
intracranial injuries such as delayed subdural haematomas 
or contusions which are slower to become evident.69 
Fortunately, most studies have shown that an initial normal 
CT scan allows safe discharge and that the few patients 
who deteriorate usually have good outcome.9, 53, 89, 130 
Therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that CT scans should 
be performed shortly after a decision is made that one is 
necessary.
Adjunctive CT scanning
Some mild head injury patients will require CT scanning for 
other reasons such as cervical spine clearance in the elderly. 
Clearly, in these circumstances, clinicians should have a 
lower threshold for performing head CT scans at the same 
time for ease of management.
Repeat CT scanning
There has been some debate in the literature about 
whether mild head injury patients who have initially 
abnormal CT scans and require admission for hospital 
observation should have a routine repeat CT scan.132-136 The 
evidence from most of these small studies suggests that
