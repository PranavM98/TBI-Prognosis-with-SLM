Practical measurement of the Glasgow Coma Scale
Assess global condition of patient, particularly noting any evidence of local injuries that might affect the measurement of 
the Glasgow Coma Scale. These include presence of endotracheal tube, tracheostomy or other airway adjunct, traumatic 
injury to eyes, mouth or limbs. The medication chart should be checked to determine if there have been any sedating 
or paralysing drugs administered, and patient notes should be checked for a history of recent alcohol or substance use. 
Document the presence of any of the above on the observations chart, or ensure that they have already been noted. Check 
the patientâ€™s correct name, and that they speak English.
