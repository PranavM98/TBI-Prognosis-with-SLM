other structural lesions does not usually significantly alter 
outcome. However, multiple studies have shown that these 
neurosurgically significant lesions are relatively uncommon 
with incidences of 0.1-3.2% for GCS 15 and 0.5-6.5% 
for GCS 14 with most of the larger studies finding that 
acute neurosurgical intervention is required in less than 
1% of mild head injury patients (see Evidence Table 1 
and Appendix 2 for more detail).32, 33, 35, 36, 47, 49-53, 68, 74, 
77, 88-90 Other intracranial injuries and skull fractures are 
more frequently noted on CT scans but are usually only 
clinically important as indicators of the potential for clinical 
complications such as delayed intracranial haematomas, 
post traumatic seizures or post concussion symptoms.52,76 
Delayed acute intracranial haematomas requiring 
neurosurgical intervention are uncommon following normal 
CT scans (range < 0.1%).13, 14, 31, 39, 91, 92
There has been much debate in the literature about the
