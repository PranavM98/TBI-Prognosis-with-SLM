All the major clinical decision rules use neurological deficit 
as an indication for CT scan or list it as an exclusion 
criteria. Focal neurological deficits have been shown to 
significantly increase the risk of intracranial injury.31, 34, 47-49, 
53, 58 Both Haydel et al32 and Stiell et al35, 56 excluded focal 
neurological deficits in their studies due to the previously 
proven nature of risk. Conversely, Vilke et al75 showed 
that a normal neurological examination does not rule out 
underlying brain injury in mild head injuries. 
Skull fractures
Clinical suspicion or evidence of skull fracture is a 
strong indication for CT scanning.32-35, 47-49, 56, 58, 62, 
66, 68, 70, 71, 74, 88, 140  
Clinical suspicion or evidence of skull fracture has been 
shown to be a significant risk factor for intracranial injury. 
The meta analyses by Hofman et al66 showed that the 
x-ray presence of skull fracture had a specificity of 95% 
for intracranial injury. Clinical suspicion or evidence of 
skull fracture has been shown by several authors including 
Stiell et al,35 Haydel et al32 and Palchek et al34 to be a 
major risk factor for the presence of intracranial injury. 
This has been supported in subsequent studies by Stiell et 
al,56 Mower et al,58 Smits et al47 and Stein et al.48 Clinical 
suspicion of open, depressed or base of skull fractures 
is based on the presence of large scalp lacerations or 
haematomas (especially in children <2 years), obvious skull 
depression, and base of skull signs such as raccoon eyes, 
haemotympanum, Battles sign, or CSF leak. Skull fracture 
should also be suspected on the basis of the mechanism of 
injury with a significant focal blunt force to the skull such 
as a bat, ball, bar, boot or club. The presence of significant 
facial fractures may also indicate the possibility of skull 
fracture.
Loss of consciousness
The absence of loss of consciousness does not rule 
out intracranial injury. Brief loss of consciousness (<5 
minutes) slightly increases risk of intracranial injury 
but should not be considered a routine indication 
for CT scan in the absence of other risk factors. 
Prolonged loss of consciousness (>5 minutes) should 
be considered a strong indication for CT scanning.1,
