The original authors believed that measurement of 
consciousness should not depend on a single measure, so 
the GCS was designed to utilise the three domains of eye 
opening, verbal response and motor response.193 These 
domains were chosen as they represent differing aspects of 
central nervous system function, measured independently 
of each other, with scores in rank order that indicate the 
degree of dysfunction. The domains are represented by 
three different behavioural responses, each assessable in 
the absence of the others, and the GCS was therefore 
considered to be more appropriate and effective than the 
imposition of subjective “levels” of function. The total GCS 
is time-efficient, and considered to be easy to sum.197
The eye opening component refers to the processing of 
information by the cerebral cortex and the level of arousal 
or wakefulness.193 The verbal response domain measures
