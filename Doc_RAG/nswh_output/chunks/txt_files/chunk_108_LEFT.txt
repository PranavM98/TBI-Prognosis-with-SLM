Level II

Level III-1
Evidence obtained from well-designed pseudo-randomised controlled trials (alternate allocation or some

 Quality assessment for individual 
studies used in guidelines
A8.5.1  Introduction
The quality of each study is an assessment of the 
methodological quality (or internal validity), and is the 
extent to which the study’s design, conduct and analysis 
has minimised selection, measurement and confounding 
biases. The process used to assess the studies included in 
Good studies
Low risk of bias
Have most or all of the relevant quality items
Fair studies
Susceptible to some bias, but not sufﬁ cient to 
invalidate results
Poor studies
High risk of bias arising from signiﬁ cant 
methodological ﬂ aws
A8.5.2   Checklists of study-specific quality 
items:
1.  Checklist for the quality assessment of systematic 
reviews:
 
 a.  Was a comprehensive and explicit search strategy 
used?
 
 b. Were the included studies assessed for quality?
