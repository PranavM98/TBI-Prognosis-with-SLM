Anti-convulsants
11. Which patients with closed head injury should receive anti-convulsants?
RECOMMENDATION
Strength of 
recommendation
Consult a senior clinician or your network neurosurgical service before commencing prophylactic anticonvulsants in patients with acute closed head injury 
Prophylactic anti-convulsants are not indicated for patients with uncomplicated mild head injury
B
Prophylactic anti-convulsants should be considered in patients with complicated mild head injury or 
moderate to severe head injury.
B
Speciﬁ c indications to consider prophylactic anti-convulsants in the ﬁ rst week following a head injury 
include:
- Extradural, subdural or intracerebral haematoma on CT
- Depressed skull fracture on CT
- Early post traumatic seizure in hospital (especially if focal or prolonged)
- Severity of head injury (low initial GCS / prolonged coma / prolonged PTA)
- Any suspicion of penetrating injury
Prophylactic anti-convulsants decrease the incidence of early post traumatic seizures within seven days 
of closed head injury.
Early post traumatic seizures have not been shown to be associated with worse patient outcomes in 
large population studies.
B
Clinical judgment is required on whether to prescribe anti-convulsants for individual patients.
CONSENSUS
Indications for anti-convulsants by post traumatic seizure type
Immediate post traumatic seizures (at time of injury) 
- Anti-convulsants not warranted unless speciﬁ c indication present (see above)
Early post traumatic seizures ( up to 7 days post injury)
- Anti-convulsants should be considered especially if any of the other speciﬁ c indications are also 
present (see above) 
Late post traumatic seizures (more than 7 days post injury)
- Long term anti-convulsants should be considered after the ﬁ rst late post traumatic seizure due to the 
increased risk of developing post traumatic epilepsy
- There is no evidence that the routine use of anti-convulsants following closed head injury reduces 
the risk of late post traumatic seizures.
