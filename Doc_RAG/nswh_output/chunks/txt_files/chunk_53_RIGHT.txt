The major risk factors for developing early post traumatic 
seizures include lower initial GCS, depressed skull fracture, 
penetrating injury, extradural/subdural/intracerebral 
haematomas and young age.12, 17, 29, 64, 182 The risk is 
therefore related to the amount of structural damage. 
Penetrating injury provides the greatest risk. The risk posed 
by an intracranial bleed is proportional to the amount of 
blood. 
Delayed or late post traumatic seizures (incidence range 
1-15%) that occur more than seven days after injury are 
associated with the development of post traumatic epilepsy. 
Risk factors for late post traumatic seizures include lower 
initial GCS, depressed skull fracture, penetrating injury, 
extradural/subdural/intracerebral haematomas, elderly (age 
>65), neurosurgical intervention and early post traumatic 
seizures.12, 17, 29, 64, 182 
Acute post traumatic seizures require systematic 
reassessment of the ABCDEs to exclude systemic causes and 
termination with benzodiazepines if required. Underlying 
structural lesions should be excluded with CT scan and then 
the need for prophylactic anti-convulsants considered.
If prophylactic anti-convulsants are recommended then 
phenytoin (dilantin) is normally given as there has been 
extensive experience with its use and it can be given as 
either an oral or an intravenous loading dose.11, 17, 29, 69, 
151 Alternatives include sodium valproate (epilim) and 
levetiracetam (keppra). Levetiracetam is being increasingly 
used in both non traumatic and traumatic epilepsy due 
to its better side effect profile and may become first line 
therapy in the future.174, 175 However, there is limited 
experience with its use in the trauma setting and phenytoin 
remains the first line therapy at present.
- Current evidence suggests that anti-convulsants 
decrease the incidence of early post traumatic seizures 
within seven days of closed head injury.17, 29, 151 
- Early post traumatic seizures have not been shown to 
be clearly associated with worse patient outcome.17, 29, 
- There is no evidence that prophylactic anti-convulsants 
following closed head injury reduce the risk of late post 
traumatic seizures.17, 29, 151 
- Anti-convulsants as a group have many potential side 
effects and are relatively poorly tolerated by patients 
long term.17, 29, 151
