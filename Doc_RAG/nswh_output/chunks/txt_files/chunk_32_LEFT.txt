GCS 13 have confirmed that an initial GCS 13 has a much 
higher rate of intracranial injury.35, 47, 56 Many other recent 
studies have used the definition of mild head injury as GCS 
14 or 15 on arrival and excluded patients with an initial 
GCS 13. Although patients with an initial GCS 14-15 have 
lower rates of intracranial injury as a group, the more recent 
studies have confirmed a higher risk of intracranial injury 
for an initial GCS 14.31, 32, 35, 47, 48, 56, 58 A number of the 
recent, well designed studies have attempted to identify risk 
factors which can predict which patients with an initial GCS 
14-15 are at highest risk.31, 32, 35, 47, 48, 56, 58 This evidence 
confirms that other risk factors can be used to successfully 
stratify risk within the initial GCS 14-15 group.
One strategy is to relate the significance of the GCS to the 
time of injury. In most of the studies on GCS 14-15, the 
reported higher risk of intracranial injury for an initial GCS 
14 does not take into account the time of injury. Recent 
studies that have reported time of presentation (Fabbri et 
al,31 Smits et al54 and Styrke et al43) have shown that mild 
head injuries present around 60 to 90 minutes post injury. 
An abnormal initial GCS taken within one hour of injury is 
therefore likely to overestimate the risk of intracranial injury 
in mild head injury patients who present early. One of the 
most relevant findings to clinical practice is that of Stiell et 
al35 who showed that for patients presenting with an initial 
GCS 13-15 that GCS <15 at two hours post injury was a 
useful predictor of risk of intracranial injury. By applying this 
criteria, both time of injury and GCS are usefully combined 
in a clinically practical assessment tool. Using GCS <15 
at two hours post injury allows for clinical judgement 
regarding patients who present immediately following 
injury or with drug or alcohol ingestion, allows for lack 
of inter observer reliability and stresses the importance of 
relating persistently abnormal GCS to time of injury. It also 
emphasises the significance of a patient presenting with 
a GCS of less than 15 or other signs of abnormal mental 
status at more than two hours after injury. 
Focal neurological deficits
Focal neurological deficit is a strong indication for CT 
scanning.31-35, 47, 48, 53, 58, 62, 68-70, 139-141
