Algorithm 2:
Initial Management of Adult Mild Closed Head Injury
Initial GCS 14-15 on arrival following blunt head trauma
Stabilise ABCDEs and assess clinical risk factors. 
Commence minimum of hourly clinical observations of vital signs, GCS, pupils, PTA and clinical symptoms
Low risk mild head injury
No indication for CT scan if all of...
- GCS 15 at 2 hours post injury.
- No focal neurological deficit.
- No clinical suspicion of skull fracture. 
- No vomiting 
- No known coagulopathy or bleeding disorder.
- Age <65 years. 
- No seizure
- Brief loss of consciousness (<5 mins). 
- Brief post traumatic amnesia (<30 mins)
- No severe headache.
- No large scalp haematoma or laceration
- Isolated head injury 
- No dangerous mechanism.
- No known neurosurgery / neurological impairment.
- No delayed presentation or representation
NOTE:
Mild acute clinical symptoms such as lethargy, nausea, dizziness, mild headache, mild 
behavioural change, amnesia for event and mild disorientation are common and are 
not associated with increased risk of intracranial injury. These clinical symptoms usually 
start to improve within 2 to 4 hours of time of injury. 
Continue minimum of hourly clinical observations until at 
least four hours post time of injury.
Clinically deteriorates or clinical symptoms not 
improving during observation period
Indication for CT scan. Continue clinical observations.
Normal CT scan
Clinical 
symptoms 
IMPROVING or 
remain normal 
during period 
of observation.
Clinical 
symptoms
IMPROVING 
at 4-6 hours 
post time of 
injury.
Clinical 
symptoms  NOT 
IMPROVING at 
4-6 hours post 
time of injury.
Clinically safe for discharge for home observation if:
- GCS 15/15 
- No persistent post traumatic amnesia (nb A-WPTAS 18/18)
- Alertness / behaviour / cognition returning to normal 
- Clinically improving after observation.
- Normal CT scan or no indication for CT scan.
-  Clinical judgment required regarding discharge and follow up of elderly 
patients or patients with known coagulopathy or bleeding disorder due to 
increased risk of delayed subdural haematoma.
Clinically safe for discharge for home observation if:
- Responsible person available to take home and observe.
- Able to return if deteriorates.
- Discharge advice is understood.
Discharge for home observation if above criteria met:
- Provide written patient advice sheet
- Provide discharge summary for GP
-  All patients should be advised to see their GP for follow up if they are not 
feeling back to normal within 2 days
-  Any patients who have minor CT abnormalities, who suffered significant 
clinical symptoms or who had prolonged post traumatic amnesia should be 
routinely referred to their GP for follow up due to an increased risk of post 
concussion symptoms.
