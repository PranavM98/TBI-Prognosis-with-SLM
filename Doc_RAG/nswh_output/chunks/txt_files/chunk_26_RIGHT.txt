CT scanning
The widespread availability of CT scanning has greatly 
assisted the management of patients with head injuries. CT 
scanning has been particularly useful in identifying focal 
injuries in patients with altered level of consciousness or 
other risk factors. CT scanning is regarded as mandatory 
for all head injury patients with a persistent altered level 
of consciousness. However, the role of the CT scanning 
in a patient with mild head injury with a normal level 
of consciousness remains controversial. Multiple clinical 
decision rules have been developed to try to identify which 
patients should have a CT scan because of concerns about 
the routine use of CT scanning for all patients. Particular 
concerns about the routine use of CT scanning for mild 
head injury include the financial-resource burden, the 
potential hazards of radiation and the potential pitfalls 
of reliance on technology at the expense of clinical 
assessment.37, 71, 88, 119-123 Furthermore, CT scans do not 
identify patients who have cognitive dysfunction which is 
the most significant complication for most patients. The 
various pros and cons of CT scanning are summarised 
below:
- Early identification of patients with intracranial injuries 
requiring acute neurosurgical intervention
- Early identification of patients with other intracranial 
injuries requiring admission to hospital due to risk of 
deterioration 
- Identification of patients at low risk of deterioration 
and suitable for discharge
- Identification of patients with structural lesions 
indicating increased risk of post concussive 
symptoms.76
- Potential cost benefit due to early CT scanning allowing 
discharge home rather than hospital admission in some 
patients.119
Cons 
- Routine use of CT scanning for mild head injury 
potentially has a huge financial and resource impact 
given that more than 90% of scans are negative 
and less than 1% of scans indicate the need for 
neurosurgical intervention.13, 35, 124 
- Some patients, particularly the elderly or those with 
a known coagulopathy, may develop delayed focal 
neurosurgical lesions (especially subdural lesions) 
despite initial normal CT scanning.69, 125, 126
