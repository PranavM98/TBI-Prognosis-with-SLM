emergency physician-based study by the same authors 
comparing different types of score found similarly low 
values.201 An Australian emergency department study 
comparing an emergency physician with a registered nurse 
found excellent agreement in the verbal and total GCS 
scores, but only intermediate agreement in the motor and 
eye scores.202 Given other work which suggests that the 
motor score is the most discriminating part of the GCS,203 
this is a cause for some concern.
Given that there is little formal training in the application 
of the GCS and that definitions of the appropriate stimuli 
to apply and the details of the responses to observe, are 
similarly scanty, it was considered useful to review the 
literature and produce a didactic guide which can be used 
by all practitioners, and attempt to increase the agreement 
in the clinical setting.
