The literature has shown that there is an increased risk of 
intracranial injury for patients aged over 60-65 years with 
mild head injury.20, 38, 47, 53, 60, 74, 85, 88, 101, 115, 162, 172, 174 All 
the recently published clinical decision rules have included 
age over 60 or 65 years as a major risk factor. Mack et al150 
recommended routine head CT for elderly patients suffering 
mild head injury as they could not identify any useful clinical 
predictors of intracranial injury in the elderly. Similarly, 
Rathlev et al151 analysed the elderly patients from the 
NEXUS II trial and found that there was an increased risk of 
intracranial risk with age and that occult presentation was 
more common. The Brain Trauma Foundation15 concluded 
that ‘increasing age is a strong independent factor in 
prognosis, with significant increase in poor outcome above 
60 years of age’ for patients with severe head injuries. 
Similarly, Williams et al76 demonstrated that elderly patients 
were more likely to sustain complications of mild head 
injury. Servadei et al6 have pointed out it is unlikely there is 
a specific age at which risk of intracranial injury dramatically 
increases. Fabbri et al31 found that using age >60 years 
alone to predict the need for CT scanning in patients with 
mild head injury was impractical from a cost-resource 
consideration during a study to validate a set of guidelines. 
Interestingly, of the 705 patients meeting guidelines criteria 
for CT scanning based on age >60 years alone who did not 
have CT scans, Fabbri et al31 found that only one patient 
deteriorated within 48 hours. It is worth noting that the 
NSW Institute of Trauma and Injury Management Trauma 
Death Review Committee has identified that in 2003 / 
2004 elderly NSW patients with head injuries represented a 
significant number of potentially preventable deaths.152 
Patients aged >65 with a mild head injury should have a 
CT scan due to the increased risk of intracranial injury. If CT 
scan is not available and the patient has no other identified 
risk factors then the absolute risk is probably small and 
clinical judgement can be used to justify prolonged 
observation rather than transfer for CT scan. Prolonged 
observation in hospital or at home should be considered 
even if an initial CT scan is normal due to the increased risk 
of delayed complications.
Abnormal alertness, behaviour or cognition
Persistent abnormal mental status manifested by 
abnormal alertness, abnormal behaviour or cognitive 
impairment is a strong indication for CT scanning.38,
