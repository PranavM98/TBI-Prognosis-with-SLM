Importantly, to facilitate these uses, an exact understanding 
of the terminology encompassed in the GCS, of the 
pathophysiological reactions underpinning response, and 
of the methodology by which various clinicians examine 
and describe the level of consciousness using the GCS, 
are essential. Unfortunately, not only are many clinicians 
unaware what the descriptions of patient reaction to a 
stimulus mean, but there also appears to be very variable 
teaching and practice in the detail of how to perform 
the examination. Studies have shown varying degrees 
of agreement between groups of clinicians performing 
the examination and assessing the level of consciousness 
with the GCS. Despite the high degree of consistency 
reported by the authors of the GCS,200 one 2004 
study201 showed only moderate agreement between two 
emergency physicians who assessed the GCS of a broad 
range of patients with differing pathologies, and a further 
Detailed breakdown of GCS components
Eye opening component
Level of response
Score
Details of response
Spontaneous
4
Indicative of activity of brainstem arousal mechanisms, but not necessarily of 
attentiveness (primitive ocular-following reﬂ exes at subcortical level)
To speech
3
Tested by any verbal approach (spoken or shouted); not necessarily the command to 
open the eyes
To pain
2
Tested by a stimulus in the limbs (supraorbital pressure may cause grimacing and eye 
closure)
None
1
No response to speech or pain
Verbal component

Oriented
5
Awareness of the self and the environment (who / where / when / why)
Confused
4
Responses to questions with presence of disorientation and confusion.
Inappropriate words
3
Speech in a random way, no conversational exchange
Incomprehensible sounds

moves to more than one site of noxious stimulus
Normal ﬂ exor response / 
withdrawal
4
Rapid withdrawal and abduction of shoulder
Abnormal ﬂ exor response
