A recent review by Stein et al in 2009 compared most 
of the best known clinical decision rules for mild head 
injury by applying them retrospectively to a prospectively 
collected data base and found that they all performed well 
for identifying acute neurosurgical lesions but differed in 
their ability to identify other lesions and their predicted CT 
scan ordering rates. The authors concluded that NEXUS 
II probably performed the best but the accompanying 
editorial commented that it would be reasonable to use any 
of the clinical decision rules.48
The Canadian CT Head Rules are the most widely studied 
and have been externally validated several times. However, 
they were applied to GCS 13-15 patients, require loss of 
consciousness or amnesia and excluded unstable multisystem trauma, coagulopathy, pre hospital seizure and 
neurological deficit. The Canadian CT Head rule therefore 
needs to be adapted for application to the broader 
population or clinicians need to be fully aware of these 
limitations when using the original rule. The NEXUS II 
clinical decision rule has not been as extensively externally 
validated but has the advantage of being relatively simple 
to use and can be used for all patients with head injury 
as there were no exclusion criteria other than delayed 
presentation and both adult and paediatric populations 
were studied. From a clinically practical point of view the 
mnemonic “BEAN BASH” can be used to remember the 
NEXUS II indications for CT scanning patients with head 
injury at the bedside:
B – behaviour abnormal; 
E – emesis; 
A – alertness abnormal; 
N – neurological deficit; 
B – bleeding disorder; 
A – age>65; 
S – skull fracture suspected; 
H – haematoma scalp.
The most important point for any clinician to recognise 
is that clinical decision rules should be used as tools to 
support clinical decisions and should not override clinical 
judgement. If clinicians choose to use a clinical decision 
rule, they should be aware of the limitations and inclusion 
/ exclusion criteria of whichever clinical decision rule they 
decide to use.
Summary
- Clinical decision rules provide useful adjuncts to the 
assessment and management of mild head injury 
patients.
