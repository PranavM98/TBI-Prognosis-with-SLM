Recently published studies and guidelines use a variety of 
criteria to define mild head injury, which is variably referred 
to as either mild head injury or mild traumatic brain injury.6, 
8-10, 13, 31-35, 46-48 The most common variations concern 
the initial classification according to GCS and different 
requirements for loss of consciousness and post traumatic 
amnesia (summarised in Appendix 1). This variation in the 
literature makes comparison between studies difficult. 
The main reason for this variability is a uniform desire to 
identify those patients at higher risk of intracranial injury in 
what is a heterogenous but essentially low risk group. There 
is ample evidence to suggest that patients with an initial 
GCS of 13 should be considered as part of the moderate 
head injury group due to the frequency of intracranial 
lesions (25-38%) and cognitive-behavioural-social sequelae 
(see Evidence Table 1 and Appendix 2).9, 36, 43, 49-56 
Since 2004 the adult literature has clearly identified that 
patients may sustain significant head injuries without loss 
of consciousness or post traumatic amnesia.9, 33, 43, 47, 
57-59 Therefore, the presence of loss of consciousness or 
post traumatic amnesia should not be used to define mild 
head injury or guide management. In 2008 Jagoda et al, 
representing the American College of Emergency Physicians 
/ Centre for Disease Control, updated their definition of 
mild head injury to reflect the change in the evidence and 
now include patients with GCS 14 on initial assessment 
and have eliminated loss of consciousness or post traumatic 
amnesia as necessary inclusion criteria.9
Further risk stratification of mild head injury is then 
dependent on the presence of associated risk factors 
and different authors have different approaches. The 
approaches of some of the best quality studies and 
guidelines are summarised in Appendix 1. It is interesting 
to note that when all the initial GCS criteria, inclusion/
exclusion criteria and sub-classification systems are all 
taken into account, that the findings are very similar. These 
findings are that mild head injury is a heterogenous group 
with patients at higher risk of increased intracranial injury 
identified by persistently abnormal GCS and certain other 
risk factors.1, 6, 8-10, 13, 31-36, 47-54, 56-81 
It is important to recognise that these risk factors for 
intracranial injury do not necessarily predict the risk of 
post concussive symptoms which are the more common 
complication of mild head injury. It is important that 
doctors, patients and their families understand that the 
absence of a structural lesion on CT scan following a mild
