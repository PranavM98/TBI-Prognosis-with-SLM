discharge from hospital. These patients would include those 
admitted to hospital for observation, those with minor 
structural lesions on CT scan, those with significant acute 
clinical symptoms in the emergency department and those 
with documented post traumatic amnesia in the emergency 
department. Elderly patients and those on anticoagulants 
should also be advised to have routine follow up organised 
due to the increased risk of complications. 
It is important that patients with mild head injury are 
able to access appropriate follow up from their local 
doctor following discharge from hospital, particularly if 
they develop significant post concussive symptoms. The 
MAA NSW Guidelines for mild traumatic brain injury 
following closed head injury103 (2008) were developed 
to assist prehospital clinicians, emergency department 
clinicians and general practitioners with the management 
of patients suffering from persistent brain injury 
symptoms following closed head injury. The MAA NSW 
MTBI guideline complements this guideline and provides 
detailed information and evidence about the recovery and 
rehabilitation of patients with mild brain injury following 
closed head injury.
