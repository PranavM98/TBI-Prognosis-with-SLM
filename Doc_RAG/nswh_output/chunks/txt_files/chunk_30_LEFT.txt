RECOMMENDATION
Strength of 
recommendation
Patients at “highest risk” of intracranial injury who should be discussed with the network neurosurgical 
service regarding urgent transfer for CT scanning include those with:
- Persistent GCS<15 at two hours post injury
- Focal neurological deﬁ cit
- Clinical suspicion of skull fracture
- Any deterioration in GCS
- Post traumatic seizure in ED 
- Known coagulopathy (particularly if age >65 or INR >4)
- Persistent vomiting or severe headache
- Persistent abnormal alertness, behaviour, cognition or PTA at 4 hours post injury.
If it is decided, after consultation with a network neurosurgical service, that a “high risk” patient does 
not require urgent transfer for CT scanning, then that patient should have close clinical observation 
in hospital for at least 24 hours and until clinically improving. If there are any signs of deterioration 
or no improvement, the network neurosurgical service should again be consulted. Rapid transfer to a 
neurosurgical centre in the event of deterioration must be available if this strategy is to be used.
If patients are transferred for CT scanning they should ideally be transferred to a hospital with 
neurosurgical facilities to avoid secondary transfer.
A skull x-ray may be useful to conﬁ rm the presence of a skull fracture that mandates an early CT scan 
due to the increased risk of deterioration.
‘Low risk’ mild head injury not requiring CT scan
The following features indicate patients with mild head injury (initial GCS 14-15) at low risk of 
having clinically signiﬁ cant lesions requiring acute neurosurgical intervention or prolonged 
observation in hospital. These patients should not routinely have CT scanning if they have all of 
the following features:
On initial assessment
- GCS 15 at two hours post injury.
- No focal neurological deﬁ cit.
- No clinical suspicion of skull fracture.
- No vomiting.
- No known coagulopathy or bleeding disorder.
- Age <65 years. 
- No post traumatic seizure
- Nil or brief loss of consciousness (<5min).
- Nil or brief post traumatic amnesia (<30min)
- No severe headache.
- No large scalp haematoma
- Isolated head injury
- No dangerous mechanism
- No known neurosurgery / neurological impairment
- No delayed presentation or representation.
After a period of observation (until at least four hours post time of injury)
- GCS 15/15 
- No post traumatic amnesia (A-WPTAS 18/18)
- Normal mental status including alertness, behaviour and cognition. 
- No clinical deterioration during observation.
- Clinically returning to normal
