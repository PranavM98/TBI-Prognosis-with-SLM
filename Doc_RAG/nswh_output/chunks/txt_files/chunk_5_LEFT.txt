Introduction
Trauma is the leading cause of death and disability in 
children and young adults in New South Wales and 
closed head injuries cause a significant proportion of this 
burden.1, 2 Closed head injury may result in lifelong physical, 
cognitive, behavioural and social dysfunction for patients 
which in turn may place major social and financial burdens 
on their families and society.3 Recent Australian figures 
indicate there are approximately 150 patients per 100,000 
population admitted to hospital each year with closed head 
injuries.3-5 Worldwide figures suggest an incidence range 
of 200-350 per 100,000 population per year for patients 
with closed head injury with mild head injury accounting 
for 80%.6 Despite the fact that closed head injuries are 
common, the classification and management of closed 
head injures remains surprisingly controversial and subject 
to variation in clinical practice.6-10 Due to the large numbers 
of patients involved it has been estimated that even 
small improvements in closed head injury management 
could have significant impact.11 Furthermore, it has been 
suggested that the greatest improvements can be made 
in the better management of those patients with mild to 
moderate head injury rather than those with severe head 
injury.12 
Much of the controversy that exists about closed head 
injury management stems from the combination of a lack 
of uniformity in definitions with a paucity of large well 
designed studies in the area.11, 13, 14 ‘Head injury’ is typically 
used to describe the initial clinical presentation whilst 
‘traumatic brain injury’ or “concussion” are used to describe 
the subsequent functional outcome. The terms “mild head 
injury”, “mild traumatic brain injury” and “concussion” are 
largely interchangeable and which term is used depends on 
whether you are examining emergency medicine, trauma, 
rehabilitation or sports medicine literature. It is difficult to 
find two studies that define mild head injury in exactly the 
same way so comparison of data can be difficult.6, 8-10, 13
Similarly, comparison of data in moderate to severe head 
injury studies is made difficult because controversy exists 
about how and when best to apply Glasgow Coma Scale 
(GCS) to sedated or intubated patients.15 Perhaps most
