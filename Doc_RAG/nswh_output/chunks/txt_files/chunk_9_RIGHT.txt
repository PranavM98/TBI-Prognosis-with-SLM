Discharge advice for patients with mild head injury 
- New section to emphasise importance of discharge 
advice
- Recent literature emphasises that all patients with 
mild head injury should be given both verbal and 
written discharge advice covering symptoms and signs 
of acute deterioration, when to seek urgent medical 
attention, lifestyle advice to assist recovery, information 
about typical post concussion symptoms and reasons 
for seeking further medical follow up. As with all 
discharge advice this should be time specific and action 
specific.
- An improved version of the original mild head injury 
advice sheet associated with this guideline has been 
developed and is now available in several languages.
Initial management of moderate head injury 
(GCS 9-13)

 Initial management of severe head injury
