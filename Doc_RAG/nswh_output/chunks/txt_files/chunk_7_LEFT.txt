Defining closed head injury
This guideline uses the terms ‘closed head injury’ and ‘mild, 
moderate or severe head injury’ to identify and classify 
patients on arrival to hospital. The outcome following 
presentation with a ‘closed head injury’ will vary from rapid 
complete recovery to a mixture of structural lesions and 
functional deficits ranging from trivial to life threatening. 
The terms “concussion” and “traumatic brain injury” refer 
to the patient outcome following their initial presentation 
with a “closed head injury” and are retrospective 
diagnoses. Important functional deficits following ‘closed 
head injury’ range from post concussion symptoms and 
post traumatic amnesia to a variety of disabling persistent 
physical-cognitive-behavioural-social sequelae. 
Many patients who suffer a “mild head injury” will have 
“mild concussion symptoms” or “mild traumatic brain injury 
symptoms”. If these acute “concussion” symptoms persist 
beyond the first few hours they are usually referred to as 
“post concussion symptoms”. The term “post concussion 
symptoms” is used to describe the clinical symptoms of 
mild brain injury that mild head injury patients may suffer 
for a few days to weeks following their injury. In the

Notes:
1. 
Generally the lower the GCS the worse the prognosis or the higher the rate of complications 
2. 
Outcome deteriorates with increasing age - “children do better and elderly do worse”
3. 
Good functional outcome being return to independent ADL and to work or school at 6 months
