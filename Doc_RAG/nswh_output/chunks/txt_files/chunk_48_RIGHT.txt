The current guideline aims to address the question of when 
to transfer patients from a non neurosurgical facility to a 
neurosurgical facility. However, there has been increasing 
interest in the issue of pre-hospital bypass of trauma 
patients to ensure that they go directly to a tertiary hospital 
with neurosurgical facilities. The primary benefit proposed 
by this strategy is to avoid undue delay in transfer to 
definitive care. There have been many studies such as the 
one by Hartl et al169 that have shown reduced mortality 
using such strategies. The Ambulance Service of NSW Pre 
Hospital Major Trauma Triage Protocol (T1)170 has adopted 
such a pre-hospital strategy for transferring all major 
trauma patients directly to a major tertiary trauma hospital 
or neurosurgical facility wherever possible.
