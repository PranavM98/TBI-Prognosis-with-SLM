pre or post traumatic seizure witnessed by a reliable 
observer probably warrants a CT scan to exclude significant 
underlying pathology even though the yield is likely to be 
low. A patient who has an early post traumatic seizure 
while in the emergency department would be considered 
to have deteriorated and would warrant a CT scan. Patients 
who have early post traumatic seizures with structural 
lesions on CT scan are at increased risk of further seizures 
and developing post traumatic epilepsy and need to be 
considered for prophylactic anti-convulsants and given 
appropriate lifestyle advice. 
Vomiting
Persistent or recurrent vomiting is a strong indication 
for CT scanning. Any vomiting is a relative indication 
for CT scanning.38, 49, 53, 60, 74, 85, 94, 97, 108, 109, 115, 131, 
133, 150, 162, 168, 172, 174, 184 
Vomiting has been identified as a significant risk factor for 
intracranial injury in many studies.38, 49, 60, 74, 94, 97, 108, 115, 
133, 162, 168, 172, 174 There has been some debate whether 
persistent vomiting is more relevant than isolated vomiting. 
Stiell et al35 identified repeated vomiting (more than one 
occasion) as being a significant risk factor for intracranial 
injury. All the major adult clinical decision rules have either 
vomiting or recurrent vomiting as a major risk factor for 
intracranial injury. In the paediatric literature recurrent 
vomiting is also considered a significant risk factor although 
it is noted that isolated vomiting is more common in 
younger children. Clement et al77 identified any vomiting 
as a significant risk factor for neurosurgical intervention in 
patients with initial GCS 15.
Headache
Persistent severe headache is a strong indication for 
CT scanning.38, 53, 74, 85, 97, 108, 109, 115, 133, 168
The literature is somewhat contradictory about the 
significance of headache. Mild headache is a common 
symptom of mild head injury but severe headache appears 
to be a significant risk factor for intracranial injury. Many 
studies have identified either headache or more commonly 
severe headache as a significant risk factor for intracranial 
injury.38, 74, 85, 97, 108, 133, 168 However, Stiell et al35 and 
Smits et al47 both found that headache was not a good 
discriminator compared to other risk factors and did not
