The terms “mild head \ninjury”, “mild traumatic brain injury” and “concussion” are \nlargely interchangeable and which term is used depends on \nwhether you are examining emergency medicine, trauma, \nrehabilitation or sports medicine literature. It is difficult to \nfind two studies that define mild head injury in exactly the \nsame way so comparison of data can be difficult.6, 8-10, 13\nSimilarly, comparison of data in moderate to severe head \ninjury studies is made difficult because controversy exists \nabout how and when best to apply Glasgow Coma Scale \n(GCS) to sedated or intubated patients.15 Perhaps most \nInitial Management of Closed Head Injury in Adults, 2nd Edition  NSW HEALTH  PAGE 3", "page": 5, "side": "LEFT", "word_count": 360, "source": "Page 5 (LEFT)"}

Important functional deficits following ‘closed \nhead injury’ range from post concussion symptoms and \npost traumatic amnesia to a variety of disabling persistent \nphysical-cognitive-behavioural-social sequelae. \nMany patients who suffer a “mild head injury” will have \n“mild concussion symptoms” or “mild traumatic brain injury \nsymptoms”. If these acute “concussion” symptoms persist \nbeyond the first few hours they are usually referred to as \n“post concussion symptoms”. The term “post concussion \nsymptoms” is used to describe the clinical symptoms of \nmild brain injury that mild head injury patients may suffer \nfor a few days to weeks following their injury.

Using GCS<15 at 2 hours post injury allows clinical judgement for patients who present soon after \ninjury or who have drug or alcohol intoxication. Drug or alcohol intoxication has not been shown to \nbe an independant risk factor for intracranial injury but persistent GCS<15 is a major risk factor and \nmandates CT. \n2.  Clinical suspicion of skull fracture includes history of focal blunt assault or injury; palpable skull fracture; \nlarge scalp haematoma or laceration; signs of base of skull fracture – haemotympanum / CSF leak / \nraccoon eyes / Battles sign.\n3.  Recurrent vomiting more concerning than isolated vomiting but both are indications.\n4.  Known coagulopathy is both a strong indication for early CT scan and to check the INR. Early reversal of \nanticoagulation if abnormal CT scan and consider reversal if initially normal CT scan with high INR (>4) \ndepending on clinical situation.\n5.  Elderly patients have increasing risk of intracranial injury with increasing age; routine CT scanning \nindicated unless totally asymptomatic patient with no other risk factors.\n6.  Brief generalised seizures immediately following head injury are not significant risk factors. Prolonged, \nfocal or delayed seizures are risk factors for intracranial injury.\n7.  Post traumatic amnesia may manifest as repetitive questioning or short term memory deficits and can \nbe objectively tested using the A-WPTAS. PTA > 30 mins is a minor risk factor and PTA > 4 hours a \nmajor risk factor for intracranial injury.\n8.  Abnormal alertness/behaviour/cognition detects subtle brain injury better than GCS and should be part \nof the bedside assessment. Family may help establish what is normal.\n9.  Multi-system trauma – beware patient with unstable vital signs or distracting injuries or who receive \nanalgesia or anaesthesia, as significant head injury is easily missed.\n10. Clinical judgement required as to what is a large scalp haematoma or laceration.\n11.  Dangerous - MVA ejection / rollover; pedestrians / cyclists hit by vehicle; falls >own height or five stairs; \nfalls from horses / cycles etc; focal blunt trauma, eg bat / ball / club.\n12.  Known neurosurgery/neurological impairment – conditions such as hydrocephalus with shunt or AVM \nor tumour or cognitive impairment such as dementia make clinical assessment less reliable and may \nincrease risk of intracranial injury.\n13.

Although four \nhours of initial neurological observations post injury are \nfairly standard following mild head injury, there is little \nevidence to support this. There is also some debate as to \nwhether the initial period of observation should be until \nfour hours post injury or for four hours following arrival \nat hospital. Studies that reported time of presentation \nshowed that most patients present at one to two hours \npost injury. Clinically most uncomplicated mild head injury \npatients will start to improve within two to four hours post \ntime of injury. Stiell et al35 demonstrated that GCS<15 at \ntwo hours post injury was one of the most significant risk \nfactors for intracranial injury. Since this guideline has used \nthese clinically important criteria, it was felt that the initial \nclinical observation period should also be based on time \npost injury rather than four hours observation from the \ntime of arrival at hospital. It is important that patients who \npresent one hour post injury are not treated the same as \nthose who present at four hours post injury with “routine \nobservations” for four hours. If the patient who presents \nat four hours post injury is not clinically improving then \nthey are at increased risk of intracranial injury and warrant \nCT scanning whereas the same patient at one hour post \ninjury probably only requires observation unless there is \nanother strong indication for CT scanning eg suspected \nskull fracture, seizure, warfarin etc. The initial period of \nneurological observation should therefore be until at \nleast four hours post time of head injury at which point \nclinical decisions should be made if they are not clinically \nimproving.", "page": 22, "side": "RIGHT", "word_count": 422, "source": "Page 22 (RIGHT)"}

This period \nof observation is derived from studies that show that \nclinical deterioration is unusual in mild head injury patients \nafter twenty four hours. Indeed, prior to the advent of CT \nscanning serial clinical observation was the standard of \ncare and the need for neurosurgical intervention in mild \nhead injury patients was largely determined on the basis \nof clinical deterioration.

CT \nscanning has been particularly useful in identifying focal \ninjuries in patients with altered level of consciousness or \nother risk factors. CT scanning is regarded as mandatory \nfor all head injury patients with a persistent altered level \nof consciousness. However, the role of the CT scanning \nin a patient with mild head injury with a normal level \nof consciousness remains controversial. Multiple clinical \ndecision rules have been developed to try to identify which \npatients should have a CT scan because of concerns about \nthe routine use of CT scanning for all patients. Particular \nconcerns about the routine use of CT scanning for mild \nhead injury include the financial-resource burden, the \npotential hazards of radiation and the potential pitfalls \nof reliance on technology at the expense of clinical \nassessment.37, 71, 88, 119-123 Furthermore, CT scans do not \nidentify patients who have cognitive dysfunction which is \nthe most significant complication for most patients.

Hall \net al120 showed a significant reduction in educational \nperformance in young children who received the equivalent \ndose of radiation of one or two CT heads for childhood \nhaemangiomas. The risk posed by radiation is greatest \nin young children due to the relatively increased dose on \nmore sensitive tissue and the increased time for a cancer to \ndevelop. Thus a person who has a CT scan as a child is at \nmuch greater risk than a person who has their first CT scan \nage 65 where the risk is very small. The risk posed by CT \nscan radiation is cumulative and is greatest in patients with \nchronic disease who have multiple scans. In patients with \nmoderate to severe head injury there is a clear benefit from \nperforming a CT scan because the probability of identifying \na life threatening injury clearly outweighs the small increase \nin the lifetime risk of cancer. In the case of patients with \nmild head injury the risk of harm from radiation needs \nto be weighed against the relatively low probability of \nidentifying a neurosurgically significant lesion on CT scan. \nThis is of most concern in younger patients where the \neffective radiation exposure is higher, the time available for \ndeveloping a cancer greater and the chance of cumulative \nlifetime exposure greater.

Although patients with an initial GCS 14-15 have \nlower rates of intracranial injury as a group, the more recent \nstudies have confirmed a higher risk of intracranial injury \nfor an initial GCS 14.31, 32, 35, 47, 48, 56, 58 A number of the \nrecent, well designed studies have attempted to identify risk \nfactors which can predict which patients with an initial GCS \n14-15 are at highest risk.31, 32, 35, 47, 48, 56, 58 This evidence \nconfirms that other risk factors can be used to successfully \nstratify risk within the initial GCS 14-15 group.\nOne strategy is to relate the significance of the GCS to the \ntime of injury. In most of the studies on GCS 14-15, the \nreported higher risk of intracranial injury for an initial GCS \n14 does not take into account the time of injury. Recent \nstudies that have reported time of presentation (Fabbri et \nal,31 Smits et al54 and Styrke et al43) have shown that mild \nhead injuries present around 60 to 90 minutes post injury. \nAn abnormal initial GCS taken within one hour of injury is \ntherefore likely to overestimate the risk of intracranial injury \nin mild head injury patients who present early. One of the \nmost relevant findings to clinical practice is that of Stiell et \nal35 who showed that for patients presenting with an initial \nGCS 13-15 that GCS <15 at two hours post injury was a \nuseful predictor of risk of intracranial injury. By applying this \ncriteria, both time of injury and GCS are usefully combined \nin a clinically practical assessment tool. Using GCS <15 \nat two hours post injury allows for clinical judgement \nregarding patients who present immediately following \ninjury or with drug or alcohol ingestion, allows for lack \nof inter observer reliability and stresses the importance of \nrelating persistently abnormal GCS to time of injury.

A routine repeat CT scan within 24 hours or an \nurgent repeat CT scan if there are any signs of deterioration \nis recommended for these patients. Clinical judgement is \nrequired about the disposition of patients with an initial \nnormal CT scan and normal INR. Prolonged observation \nand close follow up either in hospital or in the community \nis reasonable until further evidence is available to guide \nmanagement.\nThe evidence is less clear about the risk of traumatic ICH \nassociated with anti-platelet agents or bleeding disorders. \nThere are very few studies specifically addressing the issue \nand those that have been done provide contradictory \nfindings.9, 89, 129, 164 There is a clear trend to suggest \npatients on anti-platelets have an increased risk of bleeding \nfollowing intracranial haemorrhage but limited evidence \nto prove that anti-platelets independently increase the risk \nof intracranial haemorrhage for mild head injury patients. \nExtrapolating from existing anti-coagulation protocols, \npopulation studies on stroke and other studies on mild head \ninjury, it would be reasonable to postulate that increasing \nage and the presence of more than one anti-platelet agent \nwould increase the risk of bleeding. Since most patients \non anti-platelet agents are elderly and elderly patients are \nrecommended to have routine CT scans, the remaining \nclinical dilemma is what is the risk of delayed bleeding. At \npresent this remains unknown and prolonged observation \nand close follow up in the community is probably prudent. \nAge\nPatient age >65 years is a strong indication for CT \nscanning.20, 38, 47, 53, 60, 74, 85, 88, 115, 153, 162, 172, 174", "page": 35, "side": "RIGHT", "word_count": 375, "source": "Page 35 (RIGHT)"}

However, all the authors of major \nguidelines and clinical prediction rules consistently stress the \npoint that there is a very small risk of deterioration for an \nindividual patient, not to mention the possibility of medical \nerror, which is why all patients should be advised about \nsymptoms and signs of deterioration and when to seek \nurgent medical attention.\nThe most important complications of mild head injury \nto identify are those requiring acute neurosurgical \nintervention. However, functional deficits resulting in \ncognitive-behavioural-social sequelae are far more common \nand may have significant impact on patients and their \nfamilies. It is important that doctors, patients and their \nfamilies understand that the absence of a structural lesion \non CT scan following a mild head injury does not exclude \nthe possibility of significant cognitive-behavioural-social \nsequelae. Mild head injury discharge advice should include \ninformation about post concussion symptoms including \nwhat they are, how to minimise them and when to seek \nfurther medical attention if they persist. It is very important \nthat patients are informed about the potential that they \nwill have post concussion symptoms so that they are able", "page": 42, "side": "RIGHT", "word_count": 377, "source": "Page 42 (RIGHT)"}

The \nsports medicine approach to concussion of graded return \nto play translates well to all mild head injury patients.153 \nHowever, there has been a tendency in the past not to \nmention post concussion symptoms in discharge advice \nwhich may lead to unnecessary distress and confusion \nfor patients and their relatives and hinder their recovery. \nAs Jagoda et al9 for the American College of Emergency \nPhysicians pointed out, “a glaring omission from most mild \nTBI discharge instructions is the lack of any mention of \nthe possibility of the patient developing post-concussive \nsymptoms.” Holm et al102 for the WHO Collaborating \nTaskforce on Mild Traumatic Brain Injury concluded that the \nonly interventions that have been shown to be beneficial \nfor post concussion symptoms are education, reassurance \nand time. Therefore, it is important to provide education \nabout post concussion symptoms to all mild head injury \npatients.

It has since been further modified by the \nMotor Accidents Authority (MAA) NSW103 after community \ntrials to simplify the language and format in line with the \nrecommendations of Fung et al.155 This updated mild head \ninjury discharge advice sheet is included in this guideline \nand is available in several languages through the MAA \nwebsite.\nAll patients with mild head injury should be advised to \nfollow up with their local doctor if they are not feeling \nbetter within a few days.

It has been proposed that these immediate \nseizures be called “concussive convulsions” and it has been \nsuggested that they are not an epileptic phenomena.64, \n107, 134 McCrory et al145 demonstrated that outcome was \nuniversally good for these “concussive convulsions” in elite \nAustralian sportsmen.\nImmediate and early post traumatic seizures are relatively \ncommon in patients with mild closed head injury with a \nreported incidence of up to 5%.144, 173 The literature is \nsomewhat contradictory about the risk of seizures being \nassociated with intracranial injury. Many of the larger \nstudies found that post traumatic seizures were not \nsignificantly associated with intracranial injury.85, 115, 168, 172, \n174 However, Haydel et al32 found that they were significant \nand Smits et al47 found that while they were not statistically \nsignificant, included them in their decision rule because \nof their perceived clinical importance. Neidlinger et al146 \nfound that the “yield of unsuspected major intracranial \nabnormality on CT scan justifies a policy of its routine \nuse in trauma patients with seizure or who are post ictal, \nregardless of prior seizure history.”\nImmediate or early post traumatic seizures are more \ncommon (up to 30%) in patients with moderate to severe \nclosed head injury, and are more likely to be associated with \nsignificant intracranial injury.144, 173 There is an association \nwith underlying structural lesions and the potential for \nsecondary brain injury especially with prolonged, focal \nor delayed seizures. Any moderate to severe head injury \npatient who has a post traumatic seizure warrants a CT \nscan to exclude significant underlying pathology and \nthen the need for prophylactic anti-convulsants should be \nconsidered.\nInitial Management of Closed Head Injury in Adults, 2nd Edition  NSW HEALTH  PAGE 51", "page": 53, "side": "LEFT", "word_count": 409, "source": "Page 53 (LEFT)"}

Prior to this most descriptions of altered \nlevels of consciousness revolved around very subjective \nportrayals such as “comatose”, “drowsy”, “obtunded”, and \n“stuporose”.193\nThe GCS was originally described by the authors as a \nrepeated bedside assessment of the “…depth and duration \nof impaired consciousness and coma”192, and was used to \nobjectively determine the severity of coma and underlying \nbrain dysfunction at six hours following head trauma. This \ntime frame was chosen to avoid overestimation of brain \ndamage produced by temporary factors such as alcohol, \nhypoxia or hypotension,193 and similarly the GCS should be \nrecorded prior to any sedation.\nThe GCS has also been incorporated as the neurological \ncomponent of assessment into various aggregate scores \nsuch as APACHE and TRISS,193 and it has been found that \ntaking out this neurological component worsened predictive \nability, which led to the presumption that neurological \nstatus is the best predictor of overall functional outcome.194 \nThe GCS makes up 17% of the theoretical maximum Acute \nPhysiology Score (APS) in APACHE II, 19% of the APS in \nAPACHE III195 and is the basis of the World Federation of \nneurosurgeons (WFNS) subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) \ngrading scale.196 \nThe GCS, in actual fact, has evolved through both design \nand common usage to fulfil multiple functions, which are \nPAGE 94  Initial Management of Closed Head Injury in Adults, 2nd Edition  NSW HEALTH", "page": 96, "side": "LEFT", "word_count": 355, "source": "Page 96 (LEFT)"}

Withdrawal means that \nthe patient is attempting to move away from the noxious \nstimulus, sometimes by adopting a fetal position.197 This \nlast position is particularly important when there is an \ninexperienced observer, as differentiating a localising \nresponse from an abnormal flexion response may prove \ndifficult.195\nA motor component score of 3, or an abnormal flexor \nresponse, implies that the lesion is located in the cerebral \nhemispheres or internal capsule,193 whereas a score of \n2 describes a midbrain to upper pontine damage.193 \nAbnormal flexor response is complex, but involves \nadduction of upper limbs, with flexion of arms, wrists \nand fingers. Accompanying this are extension and \ninternal rotation of lower limbs, and plantar flexion of \nfeet. This must be differentiated from the normal flexor \nresponse or withdrawal, but also from extensor posturing \nwhich indicates a lesion lower in the central nervous \nsystem, and therefore reflecting CNS function at a lower \nlevel.193 Extensor posturing includes the same lower limb \nappearances as in abnormal flexion, but with the upper \nlimbs adopting a different position; this is described as \nextension of the upper limbs along the sides of the body, \naccompanied by pronation of the forearms.

Another important \ncaveat to the measurement of the motor score component \nof the GCS is that the simple “squeeze my fingers” is NOT \nsufficient or appropriate to demonstrate this function.197 A \ngrasp reflex an be elicited in many patients with decreased \ncognition, similar to that found in babies, and attempts at \nleast have to include the command to release the fingers \nafter squeezing them, and this must be seen to be obeyed. \nMore specific commands such as “show me two fingers” \nare more appropriate.\nIn the sections above, there are various conditions discussed \nwhich invalidate the measurement of specific domains of \nthe GCS, however it must always be borne in mind that \nthis tool is designed to assess consciousness and cognition, \nand that local lesions of many descriptions invalidate this \nmeasurement, and should therefore not be counted into \nan overall score at all, and should not be counted into \na domain score without documented explanation. If a \ndomain of the GCS, such as eye opening or verbal response \nis confounded by local lesions, then both snapshots and \ntrends should be limited to the use of the other domains.192, \n193 Since the motor score has been shown to contain most \nof the predictive power of the GCS, especially in the more \nseverely head injured patients, it would be reasonable to \nuse this alone in these circumstances. When this occurs, \nit has been recommended that a 1 is scored,197 however \nif this is done it has to be accompanied by a written \nexplanation and the caveat that this cannot be used in an \noverall score.\nConditions such as alcohol, drugs, inability to understand \ncommands due to language barriers, and hearing \nimpairment are all conditions that may confound the \nperformance of a GCS, and once again consideration \nneeds to be given to the reason for measuring cognition. \nFor example, if the reason the GCS is being measured \nis to assess the level of consciousness associated with a \nhead injury or pathological cause of decreased conscious \nlevel, conditions such as alcohol or sedative drugs are a \nconfounder which invalidate the GCS; however, if the \nmeasurement is being used to assess the effect of drugs on \nthe level of consciousness, this is then the relevant effect \nbeing measured. In these circumstances, however, many of \nthe correlates of a decreased level of consciousness in head \ninjury measured by GCS may not be accurate; such as an \ninability to protect the airway associated with a GCS 8, \nwhich is often not true in patients obtunded with certain \ndrugs of abuse.

Most people recover rapidly following a mild head injury. A few people may suffer from \nsymptoms over a longer period. \nThere is a small risk of you developing serious complications so you should be watched closely by another adult for \n24 hours after the accident. Please read the following. It outlines what signs to look out for after a head injury \nand what you need to do if you have problems.\nWarning Signs\n!\nIf you show any of these symptoms or signs after your head injury, or you get worse , go to \nthe nearest hospital, doctor or telephone an ambulance immediately.\nFainting or drowsiness - or you can’t wake up \n \n❖\nActing strange, saying things that do not make sense (change in behaviour) \n \n❖\nA constant severe headache or a headache that gets worse \n \n❖\nVomiting or throwing up more than twice\n \n❖\nCannot remember new events, recognise people or places (increased confusion)\n \n❖\nPass out or have a blackout or a seizure (any jerking of the body or limbs)\n \n❖\nCannot move parts of your body or clumsiness\n \n❖\nBlurred vision or slurred speech\n \n❖\nContinual ﬂuid or bleeding from the ear or nose\n \n❖\nThe ﬁrst 24-48 hours after injury\nWarning Signs\nYou should be observed and return to hospital if you develop any of \nthe above warning signs.\nRest / Sleeping\nRest and avoid strenuous activity for at least 24 hours. It is alright for you to \nsleep tonight but you should be checked every four hours by someone to make \nsure you are alright.\nDriving\nDo not drive for at least 24 hours. You should not drive until you feel much \nbetter and can concentrate properly. Talk to your doctor.\nDrinking / \nDrugs\nDo not drink alcohol or take sleeping pills or recreational drugs in the next 48 \nhours. All of these can make you feel worse.They also make it hard for other \npeople to tell whether the injury is affecting you or not.  \nPain Relief\nUse paracetamol or paracetamol/codeine for headaches.  Do not use \naspirin or anti inﬂammatory pain reliever such as ibuprofen or naproxen \n(NSAIDs), which may increase the risk of complications.\nSports\nDo not play sports for at least 24 hours.\nSee your local doctor if you are not starting to feel better within a few days of your injury.\nAdapted from “Mild Head Injury Discharge Advice” author Dr Duncan Reed (2007) Director of Trauma Gosford Hospital. NSW Institute of Trauma and Injury Management\nThis discharge advice information is taken  from the Motor Accidents Authority of NSW, Guideline for mild traumatic brain injury following closed \nhead injury – first edition 2008, ISBN 978-1-921422-08-9\nInitial Management of Closed Head Injury in Adults, 2nd Edition  NSW HEALTH  PAGE 101", "page": 103, "side": "LEFT", "word_count": 480, "source": "Page 103 (LEFT)"}
{"id": "chunk_104_LEFT", "text": "The ﬁrst 4 weeks after injury \nYou may have some common effects from the head injury which usually resolve in several weeks to three months. These are \ncalled post concussive symptoms (see below). Tiredness can exaggerate the symptoms. Return to your normal activities \ngradually (not all at once) during the ﬁrst weeks or months. You can help yourself get better by:\nRest / Sleeping\nYour brain needs time to recover. It is important to get adequate amounts of sleep \nas you may feel more tired than normal.  \nDriving\nDo not drive or operate machinery until you feel much better and can concentrate \nproperly. Talk to your doctor.\nDrinking / Drugs\nDo not drink alcohol or use recreational drugs until you are fully recovered . They \nwill make you feel much worse. Do not take medication unless advised by your \ndoctor. \nWork / Study\nYou may need to take time off work or study until you can concentrate better. Most \npeople need a day or two off work but are back full time in less than 2 weeks. How \nmuch time you need off work or study will depend on the type of job you do. See \nyour doctor and let your employer or teachers know if you are having problems at \nwork or with study.  You may need to return to study or work gradually. \nSport / Lifestyle\nIt is dangerous for the brain to be injured again if is has not recovered from the ﬁrst \ninjury. Talk to your doctor about the steps you need to take to gradually increase \nsports activity and return to play. If in doubt “sit it out”. \nRelationships\nSometimes your symptoms will affect your relationship with family and friends. You \nmay suffer irritability and mood swings. See your doctor if you or your family are \nworried. \nRecovery\nYou should start to feel better within a few days and be ‘back to normal’ within about 4 weeks. See your \nlocal doctor if you are not starting to feel better.\nYour doctor will monitor these symptoms and may refer you to a specialist if you do not improve over 4 \nweeks up to 3 months. \nPost Concussion Symptoms \nThere are common symptoms after a mild head injury. They usually go away within a few days or weeks. \nSometimes you may not be aware of them until sometime after your injury like when you return to work.\nFeeling more tired than usual and  lacking energy \n \n❖\nMild headaches (that won’t go away)\n \n❖\nHaving more trouble than usual with  attention & \n \n❖\nIrritability.
