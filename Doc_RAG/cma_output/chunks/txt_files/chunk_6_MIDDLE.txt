Ontario revealed that closed head injuries produce some of the most common and severe anatomic lesions in
pediatric trauma.82 Thus, the social
and economic impact of head trauma
in North America is substantial and
provides the impetus for ongoing research into clinical prevention, management and repair strategies. Trauma
system regionalization has resulted in
more efficient patient management
and improved clinical outcomes
following systemic injuries.72,83–86 The
development and promotion of evidence-based treatment guidelines and
decision rules also facilitate injury assessment, resuscitation and patient
disposition.87–89
Unfortunately, although there are limited studies that
suggest that implementation of treatment protocols may also benefit TBI
patients, many aspects of TBI care remain without objective support and
current medical practices vary according to regional experiences and resource availability.90–92
Conclusions
Head trauma produces a wide spectrum of injury and requires proficient
early management to detect occult
lesions and prevent secondary cerebral insults. We have created and disseminated a novel reference guide,
based on the current state of knowledge, as part of an initiative to standardize the assessment and early
management of TBI in Nova Scotia.
This instrument may be easily modified for other geographical regions.
Its implementation is expected to
improve patient outcomes by facilitating management decisions in the
emergency department and expediting the transfer of appropriate individuals to neurosurgical expertise.
