Head injury guideline
Minor head injuries (GCS 13–15) in
pediatric patients
Children aged less than 2 years
Most pediatric head injuries do not
require surgical intervention.36–39
Unusual or unexplained trauma in
young children should raise a suspicion of abuse and be duly investigated. Those aged under 2 years require judicious management, because
the growing calvarium and immature
brain are susceptible to relatively lowimpact forces.40–42 In addition, clinical
signs of TBI are unreliable at this age,
and neurological evaluation is hampered by limited verbal and behavioural repertoires.43,44 Any suggestion
of TBI warrants further investigation,
accepting that radiographic imaging
may require sedation, with the associated risks of cardiovascular and respiratory complications.9,43,45,46
The highest incidence of skull
fractures and intracranial injuries 
occurs in children aged under
1 year.47–49 Diagnosis of a skull fracture is important to ensure that clinical follow-up is arranged to monitor
for the presence of a growing skull
fracture. Scalp hematomas are a useful predictor of underlying fractures
in young children, but up to 50% of
asymptomatic patients will have skull
