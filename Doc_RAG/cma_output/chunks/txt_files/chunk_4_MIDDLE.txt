mend either observation or CT scanning for neurologically normal (i.e.,
GCS score of 15) children who have
experienced loss of consciousness
and recommend observation only for
those who have not.7 More recent
guidelines favour CT studies for children with amnesia, a history of loss
of consciousness, impaired mental
status, focal neurological deficits, evidence of skull fracture or coagulopathy.60 Children who meet the criteria
for an urgent CT, and where the CT
is abnormal, require prompt neurosurgical consultation (Box 3).
Major head injuries (GCS 3–12) in
adult and pediatric patients
Standard trauma guidelines recommend that patients with major head
injuries receive aggressive cardiopulmonary and hemodynamic resuscitation unless an obvious reason exists
to withhold treatment.61 Cervical
spine fractures and systemic injuries
are present in 6% to 8% and 50% of
these patients, respectively, and must
be considered during the resuscitative
phase of treatment.62–64 The incidence
of secondary brain injuries can be sigBox 4: Approach to patients with major head injuries*†

†Resuscitation and transfer to a neurosurgical service should be the priority of
acute care. Spinal and systemic injuries are commonly associated and must
be considered during treatment. A brief neurological examination provides
valuable clinical information for monitoring and assessment by the receiving
physicians, particularly if performed before the administration of sedatives or
paralytic agents.
