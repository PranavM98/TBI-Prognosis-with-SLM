subject headings “head injury” 
and “management.” Searches were
culled to identify articles regarding
prehospital, emergency department
and intensive care of TBI patients,
as well as guideline publications and
review articles that addressed regionalized approaches to trauma
and TBI management. Current recommendations 
included 
those
founded by multiple clinical groups,
substantiated by long-term conventional applications, and supported
by a well-designed cohort or randomized trials. This instrument is
intended to facilitate the management of traumatic head injuries in
the emergency department and,
apart from resuscitative measures,
does not provide recommendations
regarding prehospital or definitive
care. After consultation with the
provincial trauma and critical care
communities, we distributed this
guideline to all emergency departments throughout Nova Scotia.
