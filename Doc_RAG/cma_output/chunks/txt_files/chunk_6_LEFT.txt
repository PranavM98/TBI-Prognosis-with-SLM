of the nontertiary care head injuries
in the entire province and, thus, are
immediately served by this clinical
guideline. A recent survey of the
emergency medicine department
chiefs for these regional hospitals was
conducted (December 2005–January
2006). The survey was constructed
with a modified Dillman technique; a
copy of the survey is available from
the authors on request.73 Surveys
were mailed out with a self-addressed
envelope, and subsequent telephone
follow-up was performed twice. With
the small number of subjects (8), the
response rate was 100%. The survey
results show that the guideline is currently being used at each centre and
is posted in all 8 emergency departments. The survey also demonstrates
that the guideline has been “beneficial to the management of TBI patients” (100% response) and has led
to modifications in local practice,
such as CT imaging, earlier patient
transfer or both in 50% of the regional centres.
Discussion
Injuries are the largest contributor to
mortality in people aged under 40
years and represent the fourth overall
cause of death in North America.74–77
The annual incidence of TBI in the
United States has been estimated between 100 and 367 per 100 000 population, and billions of dollars are
spent each year on medical, social and
rehabilitation services.6,78,79 The high
incidence of TBI in young adults contributes to an enormous loss of potential life years, with the American
prevalence between 2.5 and 6.5 million individuals.79 In Canada, population-based data are limited; nonetheless, approximately 18 000 patients
are admitted to hospital annually for
head injuries, and regional incidences
have been reported at 16 and 7 per
10 000 per year in male and female
patients, respectively (Kingston, Ontario)80 and 14 per 10 000 population
per year aged over 16 years (Nova
Scotia).81 A 4-year review in eastern
