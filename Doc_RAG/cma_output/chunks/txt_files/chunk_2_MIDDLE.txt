rosurgical service operates at adult
and pediatric tertiary care centres located in Halifax and receives all major
neurotrauma patients in the province.
Ground and air ambulance activity is
organized by a central dispatchment
unit that is accessible province-wide
via a 24-hour trauma hotline. In optimal conditions, each municipality is
within 90 minutes travel by helicopter from Halifax, and all efforts
are made to transport patients, by
ground or air, immediately to the
most appropriate hospital. The role
of the neurosurgical service within
this type of health system is ideal for
assessing the impact of regionalized
protocols in the management of
acute head trauma. In this report, we
present evidence for a novel reference
guide that was developed as part of a
population-based initiative to standardize the care of adult and pediatric
patients with head injuries who present to emergency departments
throughout Nova Scotia.
