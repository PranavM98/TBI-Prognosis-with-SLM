nificantly reduced by prevention of
hypoxia, hypotension and elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). Maintenance of a cerebral perfusion pressure
70 mm Hg or greater may reduce
TBI mortality and, in the absence of
marked ICP elevation, can usually be
achieved with a mean arterial blood
pressure of 90 mm Hg.6 Intracranial
hypertension develops in 40% of patients with severe TBI and may be associated with anisocoria, papilledema,
neurological deficits or a deteriorating level of consciousness.65 Valsalva
manoeuvres produced by cough,
movement or pain elevate ICP and
often require suppression with narcotics, sedatives or paralytic agents.
Osmotic diuretics (e.g., mannitol)
and hyperventilation reduce ICP, in
part, by decreasing cerebral interstitial
and intravascular volumes, respectively.6,66,67 These measures require
prudent monitoring and fluid management, because subsequent hypovolemia and hypocarbia may exacerbate cerebral ischemia.68,69 Brief
periods of hyperventilation are currently reserved for use in acute herniation syndromes with brainstem
compromise. If the ICP cannot be
