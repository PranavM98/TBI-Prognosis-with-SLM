intracranial complications have been
reported in up to 17% of people with
apparently trivial head injuries, emphasizing the significance of a structured
evaluation of these patients at initial
presentation.5 In contrast, the need for
aggressive resuscitation and intensive
care monitoring is often quickly recognized after severe TBI; however, important issues regarding the timing
and nature of the resuscitative efforts,
as well as the urgency of patient transport and neurosurgical consultation,
may be poorly defined.5–10 Standardized algorithms and clinical predictors

injury have been reported and validated, yet the impact of regionalized
TBI care on patient outcomes remains
unknown. To our knowledge, there
have been no clinical decision tools
published that provide a comprehensive approach, based on the current
state of knowledge, to the acute care
of adult and pediatric patients who
present to the emergency department
with head injuries.
