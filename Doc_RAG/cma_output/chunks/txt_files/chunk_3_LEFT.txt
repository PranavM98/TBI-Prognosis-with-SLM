with head injuries according to
their age and presenting Glasgow
Coma Scale (GCS) score, because
both of these parameters influence management and prognosis
(Box 1). The GCS score remains
the most widely used measure of
neurological function in TBI patients and has significant prognostic
value when graded in the absence
of sedation, chemical paralysis or
intoxication.15–19 The GCS has high
inter- and intraobserver reliability
and has been used to arbitrarily define injury severity as mild (GCS
score 13–15), moderate (GCS score
9–12) or severe (GCS score 3–8).
Because the acute management of
moderate and severe head trauma is
comparable, the current recommendations are based on the simpler dichotomy of minor (GCS
13–15) and major (GCS 3–12) categories. The pediatric GCS that is included in the guideline is a modified
version of the original scale and is
one of several triage-scoring systems
adapted for children.20,21
Minor head injuries (GCS 13–15) in
adult patients
Minor head injuries are associated
with a brief loss of consciousness,
disorientation or amnesia in patients with a GCS score of 13
to 15.15,22,23 Most patients are stable
at the time of examination, and it is
important to recognize those at risk
of occult or evolving intracranial 
lesions. Several groups have attempted to identify reliable indicators of intracranial injury and the
need for urgent CT.11,12,24,25 The
Canadian CT Head Rule predicts
the need for neurological intervention with a sensitivity of 100% and a
95% confidence interval between
92% and 100%.12,26 The 3-year study
data were compiled from 3121
adult patients in 10 Canadian centres and identified 5 clinical signs
that have previously been associated
with TBI. Patients with minor head
injuries and evidence of prolonged
