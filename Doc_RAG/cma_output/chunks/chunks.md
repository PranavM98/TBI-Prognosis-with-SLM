intracranial complications have been
reported in up to 17% of people with
apparently trivial head injuries, emphasizing the significance of a structured
evaluation of these patients at initial
presentation.5 In contrast, the need for
aggressive resuscitation and intensive
care monitoring is often quickly recognized after severe TBI; however, important issues regarding the timing
and nature of the resuscitative efforts,
as well as the urgency of patient transport and neurosurgical consultation,
may be poorly defined.5–10 Standardized algorithms and clinical predictors

injury have been reported and validated, yet the impact of regionalized
TBI care on patient outcomes remains
unknown. To our knowledge, there
have been no clinical decision tools
published that provide a comprehensive approach, based on the current
state of knowledge, to the acute care
of adult and pediatric patients who
present to the emergency department
with head injuries.

rosurgical service operates at adult
and pediatric tertiary care centres located in Halifax and receives all major
neurotrauma patients in the province.
Ground and air ambulance activity is
organized by a central dispatchment
unit that is accessible province-wide
via a 24-hour trauma hotline. In optimal conditions, each municipality is
within 90 minutes travel by helicopter from Halifax, and all efforts
are made to transport patients, by
ground or air, immediately to the
most appropriate hospital. The role
of the neurosurgical service within
this type of health system is ideal for
assessing the impact of regionalized
protocols in the management of
acute head trauma. In this report, we
present evidence for a novel reference
guide that was developed as part of a
population-based initiative to standardize the care of adult and pediatric
patients with head injuries who present to emergency departments
throughout Nova Scotia.

subject headings “head injury” 
and “management.” Searches were
culled to identify articles regarding
prehospital, emergency department
and intensive care of TBI patients,
as well as guideline publications and
review articles that addressed regionalized approaches to trauma
and TBI management. Current recommendations 
included 
those
founded by multiple clinical groups,
substantiated by long-term conventional applications, and supported
by a well-designed cohort or randomized trials. This instrument is
intended to facilitate the management of traumatic head injuries in
the emergency department and,
apart from resuscitative measures,
does not provide recommendations
regarding prehospital or definitive
care. After consultation with the
provincial trauma and critical care
communities, we distributed this
guideline to all emergency departments throughout Nova Scotia.

with head injuries according to
their age and presenting Glasgow
Coma Scale (GCS) score, because
both of these parameters influence management and prognosis
(Box 1). The GCS score remains
the most widely used measure of
neurological function in TBI patients and has significant prognostic
value when graded in the absence
of sedation, chemical paralysis or
intoxication.15–19 The GCS has high
inter- and intraobserver reliability
and has been used to arbitrarily define injury severity as mild (GCS
score 13–15), moderate (GCS score
9–12) or severe (GCS score 3–8).
Because the acute management of
moderate and severe head trauma is
comparable, the current recommendations are based on the simpler dichotomy of minor (GCS
13–15) and major (GCS 3–12) categories. The pediatric GCS that is included in the guideline is a modified
version of the original scale and is
one of several triage-scoring systems
adapted for children.20,21
Minor head injuries (GCS 13–15) in
adult patients
Minor head injuries are associated
with a brief loss of consciousness,
disorientation or amnesia in patients with a GCS score of 13
to 15.15,22,23 Most patients are stable
at the time of examination, and it is
important to recognize those at risk
of occult or evolving intracranial 
lesions. Several groups have attempted to identify reliable indicators of intracranial injury and the
need for urgent CT.11,12,24,25 The
Canadian CT Head Rule predicts
the need for neurological intervention with a sensitivity of 100% and a
95% confidence interval between
92% and 100%.12,26 The 3-year study
data were compiled from 3121
adult patients in 10 Canadian centres and identified 5 clinical signs
that have previously been associated

risk of requiring neurological treatment and should have urgent CT
imaging. Although a normal CT
scan does not preclude latent hemorrhage, the incidence of significant
deterioration in these patients is exceedingly low and justifies chaperoned discharge when clinically
well.35 In contrast, radiographic evidence of intracranial injury warrants
a neurosurgical consultation. If the
patient is being evaluated in a tertiary care centre, the neurosurgical
housestaff should be contacted directly. However, if the emergency
department encounter occurs in a
nontertiary centre, the attending
physician should immediately contact the local neurosurgeon on-call,
which, in our system, may be accomplished by calling the Trauma
Hotline. The neurosurgeon on-call
is available to review the history
(via telephone contact with the referring 
emergency 
department
physician) and radiology (via viewing the CT scan on a province-wide
real-time digital imaging system)
and will provide advice regarding
patient disposition and management (Box 2).

pediatric patients
Children aged less than 2 years
Most pediatric head injuries do not
require surgical intervention.36–39
Unusual or unexplained trauma in
young children should raise a suspicion of abuse and be duly investigated. Those aged under 2 years require judicious management, because
the growing calvarium and immature
brain are susceptible to relatively lowimpact forces.40–42 In addition, clinical
signs of TBI are unreliable at this age,
and neurological evaluation is hampered by limited verbal and behavioural repertoires.43,44 Any suggestion
of TBI warrants further investigation,
accepting that radiographic imaging
may require sedation, with the associated risks of cardiovascular and respiratory complications.9,43,45,46
The highest incidence of skull
fractures and intracranial injuries 
occurs in children aged under
1 year.47–49 Diagnosis of a skull fracture is important to ensure that clinical follow-up is arranged to monitor
for the presence of a growing skull
fracture. Scalp hematomas are a useful predictor of underlying fractures
in young children, but up to 50% of
asymptomatic patients will have skull

or intracranial injuries without evidence of scalp trauma or neurological deficits.44,48,50–52 Therefore, it is recommended that children aged under
2 years undergo CT imaging if there
is evidence of a neurological abnormality, such as decreased level of
consciousness, nausea, lethargy or
agitation. All asymptomatic children
under age 1 year who present with a
scalp hematoma require skull radiography and, if abnormal, a subsequent
CT scan and neurosurgical consultation (Box 3).45,52–54
Children aged 2 to 15 years
Children in this age group with recent head trauma and a GCS score of
13 or 14 are at high risk of harbouring an intracranial lesion and 
require urgent CT imaging.55–57
Post-traumatic amnesia and loss of
consciousness have traditionally been
considered risk factors for TBI; however, there are no prospective studies
that have identified one or more clinical signs that accurately predict intracranial abnormalities.9,39,51,58,59 The
guidelines published by the American Academy of Pediatrics recomBox 3: Approach to children with minor head injuries*†
Age < 2 yr
Urgent CT head indicated if symptomatic (vomiting,
lethargic, irritable) or neurologically abnormal.
If asymptomatic and neurologically normal, no further
studies are required, except for children < 1 year with a
scalp hematoma; then, obtain skull x-rays and CT head if
plain radiography is abnormal.
Age 2 to 15 yr
Obtain CT head if GCS < 15.
If GCS = 15 and there is a history of loss of consciousness or
posttraumatic amnesia, then either CT head or observe

and present a difficult population to assess owing to limited verbal and
behavioural repertoires. Evidence of child abuse must be thoroughly
investigated.

mend either observation or CT scanning for neurologically normal (i.e.,
GCS score of 15) children who have
experienced loss of consciousness
and recommend observation only for
those who have not.7 More recent
guidelines favour CT studies for children with amnesia, a history of loss
of consciousness, impaired mental
status, focal neurological deficits, evidence of skull fracture or coagulopathy.60 Children who meet the criteria
for an urgent CT, and where the CT
is abnormal, require prompt neurosurgical consultation (Box 3).
Major head injuries (GCS 3–12) in
adult and pediatric patients
Standard trauma guidelines recommend that patients with major head
injuries receive aggressive cardiopulmonary and hemodynamic resuscitation unless an obvious reason exists
to withhold treatment.61 Cervical
spine fractures and systemic injuries
are present in 6% to 8% and 50% of
these patients, respectively, and must
be considered during the resuscitative
phase of treatment.62–64 The incidence
of secondary brain injuries can be sigBox 4: Approach to patients with major head injuries*†

†Resuscitation and transfer to a neurosurgical service should be the priority of

be considered during treatment. A brief neurological examination provides
valuable clinical information for monitoring and assessment by the receiving
physicians, particularly if performed before the administration of sedatives or
paralytic agents.

nificantly reduced by prevention of
hypoxia, hypotension and elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). Maintenance of a cerebral perfusion pressure
70 mm Hg or greater may reduce
TBI mortality and, in the absence of
marked ICP elevation, can usually be
achieved with a mean arterial blood
pressure of 90 mm Hg.6 Intracranial
hypertension develops in 40% of patients with severe TBI and may be associated with anisocoria, papilledema,
neurological deficits or a deteriorating level of consciousness.65 Valsalva
manoeuvres produced by cough,
movement or pain elevate ICP and
often require suppression with narcotics, sedatives or paralytic agents.
Osmotic diuretics (e.g., mannitol)
and hyperventilation reduce ICP, in
part, by decreasing cerebral interstitial
and intravascular volumes, respectively.6,66,67 These measures require
prudent monitoring and fluid management, because subsequent hypovolemia and hypocarbia may exacerbate cerebral ischemia.68,69 Brief
periods of hyperventilation are currently reserved for use in acute herniation syndromes with brainstem
compromise. If the ICP cannot be

invasive procedures such as ventricular
drain placement or decompressive
craniectomy may be considered by the
attending neurosurgeon.
If a patient with severe TBI is being evaluated at the scene or requires
resuscitation at a peripheral hospital,
the immediate goals should be cardiopulmonary and hemodynamic stabilization followed by prompt transfer
to a neurosurgical centre. Investigations that are not directly related to
resuscitative efforts should be postFIG. 1. The Nova Scotia Head Injury Guideline. The telephone numbers and directives for specific transport protocols displayed

definitive care. Delayed treatment significantly impacts clinical outcome,
and the mortality of specific intracranial lesions may be reduced by as
much as 66% if patients receive
surgery within 4 hours of injury.8,70–72

of the nontertiary care head injuries
in the entire province and, thus, are
immediately served by this clinical
guideline. A recent survey of the
emergency medicine department
chiefs for these regional hospitals was
conducted (December 2005–January
2006). The survey was constructed
with a modified Dillman technique; a
copy of the survey is available from
the authors on request.73 Surveys
were mailed out with a self-addressed
envelope, and subsequent telephone
follow-up was performed twice. With
the small number of subjects (8), the
response rate was 100%. The survey
results show that the guideline is currently being used at each centre and
is posted in all 8 emergency departments. The survey also demonstrates
that the guideline has been “beneficial to the management of TBI patients” (100% response) and has led
to modifications in local practice,
such as CT imaging, earlier patient
transfer or both in 50% of the regional centres.
Discussion
Injuries are the largest contributor to
mortality in people aged under 40
years and represent the fourth overall
cause of death in North America.74–77
The annual incidence of TBI in the
United States has been estimated between 100 and 367 per 100 000 population, and billions of dollars are
spent each year on medical, social and
rehabilitation services.6,78,79 The high
incidence of TBI in young adults contributes to an enormous loss of potential life years, with the American
prevalence between 2.5 and 6.5 million individuals.79 In Canada, population-based data are limited; nonetheless, approximately 18 000 patients
are admitted to hospital annually for
head injuries, and regional incidences
have been reported at 16 and 7 per
10 000 per year in male and female
patients, respectively (Kingston, Ontario)80 and 14 per 10 000 population
per year aged over 16 years (Nova
Scotia).81 A 4-year review in eastern

Ontario revealed that closed head injuries produce some of the most common and severe anatomic lesions in
pediatric trauma.82 Thus, the social
and economic impact of head trauma
in North America is substantial and
provides the impetus for ongoing research into clinical prevention, management and repair strategies. Trauma
system regionalization has resulted in
more efficient patient management
and improved clinical outcomes
following systemic injuries.72,83–86 The
development and promotion of evidence-based treatment guidelines and
decision rules also facilitate injury assessment, resuscitation and patient
disposition.87–89
Unfortunately, although there are limited studies that
suggest that implementation of treatment protocols may also benefit TBI
patients, many aspects of TBI care remain without objective support and
current medical practices vary according to regional experiences and resource availability.90–92
Conclusions
Head trauma produces a wide spectrum of injury and requires proficient
early management to detect occult
lesions and prevent secondary cerebral insults. We have created and disseminated a novel reference guide,
based on the current state of knowledge, as part of an initiative to standardize the assessment and early
management of TBI in Nova Scotia.
This instrument may be easily modified for other geographical regions.
Its implementation is expected to
improve patient outcomes by facilitating management decisions in the
emergency department and expediting the transfer of appropriate individuals to neurosurgical expertise.
