and patients. Although there have been some major developments in severe TBI management, for other topics in this edition
it was not possible to make new evidence-based recommendations. The options are to wait for better evidence to be produced
or to situate our reviews and guidelines in a larger enterprise.
Our vision is a recursive structure that includes ongoing publication monitoring, systematic reviews and synthesis, and guidelines that then contribute back to the development and execution
of a research agenda that can provide the evidence base for more
comprehensive guidelines. We anticipate that this agenda also
will promote the development and use of increasingly rigorous
research methods in individual studies as well as reviews. A
detailed and comprehensive future research agenda is provided
in the comprehensive guideline document available online at
