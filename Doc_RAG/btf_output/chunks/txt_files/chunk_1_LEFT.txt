The scope and purpose of this work is 2-fold: to synthesize the available evidence and
to translate it into recommendations. This document provides recommendations only
when there is evidence to support them. As such, they do not constitute a complete
protocol for clinical use. Our intention is that these recommendations be used by others
to develop treatment protocols, which necessarily need to incorporate consensus and
clinical judgment in areas where current evidence is lacking or insufficient. We think it is
important to have evidence-based recommendations to clarify what aspects of practice
currently can and cannot be supported by evidence, to encourage use of evidence-based
treatments that exist, and to encourage creativity in treatment and research in areas where
evidence does not exist. The communities of neurosurgery and neuro-intensive care have
been early pioneers and supporters of evidence-based medicine and plan to continue
in this endeavor. The complete guideline document, which summarizes and evaluates
the literature for each topic, and supplemental appendices (A-I) are available online at
https://www.braintrauma.org/coma/guidelines.

the
Fourth
Edition
of
the
“Brain
Trauma Foundation’s Guidelines for the
Management of Severe Traumatic Brain
Injury,” there are 189 publications included
as evidence to support 28 recommendations
covering 18 topics. The publication reports on
5 Class 1 studies, 46 Class 2 studies, 136 Class
3 studies, and 2 meta-analyses. This synopsis
provides an overview of the process, includes the
updated recommendations, and describes the
new evidence added. The complete guideline
document, which summarizes and evaluates
the literature for each topic, and supplemental appendices (A-I) are available online at
https://www.braintrauma.org/coma/guidelines.
Reviewed for evidence-based integrity
and endorsed by the American
Association of Neurological Surgeons
and the Congress of Neurological
Surgeons.
During the past 20 years, the brain trauma
community’s approach to guideline development
has evolved as the science and application of
evidence-based medicine has advanced. This new
iteration of the guidelines reflects the most
current methodologic standards and establishes
