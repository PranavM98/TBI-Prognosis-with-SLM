BRAIN TRAUMA FOUNDATION TBI GUIDELINES
duration, resulting in a lack of standardized management across
multiple centers
• Expanded data collection to meet multiple agency requirements
• Outcome measures that may not be clinically relevant
• Shortened time to complete follow-up
• Effect size requirements that may be statistically, but not clinically, relevant
• Budget constraints
The rationale for subjecting an effective single-center trial to
the variability encountered in a large multi-center trial is valid.
Ideally, a treatment should be effective across various clinical
environments. However, failure at the multi-center level could
be the result of factors other than, or in addition to, lack of a
robust treatment effect. Variability in research protocols, patient
assessments, and data collection and management could be
washing out the potential effects of the interventions we are
studying.
Also in the spirit of critical self-examination is this question:
What does our community need to do to produce a substantial
and permanent shift in the quality of the studies we are generating? The direct approach of wagging the evidence-based finger
is not changing research practice. What is in the background of
our worldview and frame of reference for research that is influencing our selection of research models and designs? How does
the current paradigm for brain trauma allow for the persistence
of studies that use designs and protocols we know in advance will
not produce strong evidence? Discovery at this contextual level
