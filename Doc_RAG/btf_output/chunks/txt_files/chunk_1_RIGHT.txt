more rigorous procedures for future work. As
a result, the guidelines include changes in the
evaluation of previous work, an increase in the
quality of the included studies, and essential
improvements in the precision of the recommendations. Details on the changes within each
topic from the Third1 to this Fourth Edition
are listed in Appendix A in the complete Fourth
Edition Guidelines and are described in the
sections on each topic in the comprehensive
guideline document. These are available online at
https://www.braintrauma.org/coma/guidelines.
Despite these improvements, the recommendations are limited in many areas, reflecting
persisting gaps in the evidence base for severe
traumatic brain injury (TBI) management.
Although there have been numerous new publications in the field since the Third Edition of
the Guidelines was published in 2007,1 many
repeat the same methodologic flaws found in
previous research. The comprehensive guideline
document includes an examination of the current
condition of brain trauma clinical research,
outlines how this condition is defining and
shaping the future, and proposes a solution in
establishing a formal evidence-based consortium.
