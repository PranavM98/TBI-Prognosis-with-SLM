Another 27 studies present new evidence, but, for various
reasons (eg, single studies with small samples, inconsistent results
across studies, lack of precision), they were assessed as insufficient to support adding or changing a recommendation. The
remaining 34 new studies met the inclusion criteria, but they
supplement the findings of the previous research that informed
existing recommendations and did not change the findings or
the strength of evidence. All the included studies are cited and
discussed in the comprehensive guideline document available
online at https://www.braintrauma.org/coma/guidelines.
Future Research
Management of patients with TBI is not a function of
the application of individual treatments. No treatment or
management approach exists independent of other treatments
and approaches, or independent of the ecology. The design of
meaningful and effective future research needs to be consistent
with this clinical reality. The brain trauma community needs to
design and engage in a systematic process for developing a research
agenda that begins with thoughtful conversations about scope,
topics, management environments, and research methods. The
process should include (1) identification and refinement of topics
for studies that could serve to fill critical gaps in the guidelines,
(2) improvement of study designs, and (3) incorporation of stateof-the-art methods for synthesizing literature, assessing bodies of
evidence, and generating guidelines.
