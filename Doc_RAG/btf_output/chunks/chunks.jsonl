Hawryluk, MD,\nThe scope and purpose of this work is 2-fold: to synthesize the available evidence and\nto translate it into recommendations. This document provides recommendations only\nwhen there is evidence to support them. As such, they do not constitute a complete\nprotocol for clinical use. Our intention is that these recommendations be used by others\nto develop treatment protocols, which necessarily need to incorporate consensus and\nclinical judgment in areas where current evidence is lacking or insufficient. We think it is\nimportant to have evidence-based recommendations to clarify what aspects of practice\ncurrently can and cannot be supported by evidence, to encourage use of evidence-based\ntreatments that exist, and to encourage creativity in treatment and research in areas where\nevidence does not exist. The communities of neurosurgery and neuro-intensive care have\nbeen early pioneers and supporters of evidence-based medicine and plan to continue\nin this endeavor.

{"id": "chunk_2_LEFT", "text": "Scope of the Guidelines\nThe guidelines address treatment interventions, monitoring,\nand treatment thresholds that are specific to TBI or that address\na risk that is greater in patients with TBI. The guidelines are not\nintended to cover all topics relevant to the care of patients with\nsevere TBI. Topics related to general good care for all patients, or\nall trauma patients, are not included.\nDeveloping protocols that integrate TBI-specific, evidencebased recommendations with general best practices for trauma\npatients, and that provide guidance, suggestions, or options in\nareas of TBI management where the evidence is insufficient, is\noutside the scope of these guidelines. These recommendations\nare intended to provide the foundation on which protocols can\nbe developed that are appropriate to different treatment environments.\nLiving Guidelines\nThis Fourth Edition of the Guidelines is transitional. We do\nnot intend to produce a Fifth Edition. Rather, we are moving\nto a model of continuous monitoring of the literature, rapid\nupdates to the evidence review, and revisions to the recommendations as the evidence warrants. We call this the Living Guidelines model. This is driven by several trends, including advances in\ntechnology, the increasing volume of available information, and\nthe corresponding change in expectations among clinicians and\nother stakeholders. A static document that is updated after several\nyears no longer responds to the demands of the community we\nserve.\nThe first test of this approach will involve incorporating the\nresults of the RESCUEicp (Randomised Evaluation of Surgery\nwith Craniectomy for Uncontrollable Elevation of ICP) study,\nwhich was published just after the completion of this edition.\nThis study is a randomized, controlled trial that evaluates decompressive craniectomy as a secondary procedure, after ICP-targeted\nmedical therapies have failed.2 The results of this trial will be\nevaluated and may impact recommendations related to decompressive craniectomy as well as ICP thresholds.\nMETHODS\nThe development of guidelines encompasses 2 major activities: first,\na systematic review and synthesis of evidence; and second, the derivation\nof recommendations.\nSystematic Evidence Review and Synthesis\nLiterature Search and Review\nOur literature search protocol is detailed in the comprehensive\nguideline document, and the search strategies are in Appendix D\nto the same document.

Detailed inclusion criteria and a list of studies excluded\nafter full-text review are in the comprehensive guideline document in\nAppendices E and F.\nQuality Assessment and Data Abstraction of Individual\nStudies\nAll included studies were assessed for potential bias, which is a\nsystematic approach to assessing the internal validity or quality of\nstudies. The criteria used in the Third Edition were maintained and\napplied to the newly identified studies of monitoring and treatments.\nThe criteria for threshold studies were revised to be specific to the\nstructure of threshold studies (see Appendix G for a complete list of\nthe quality criteria used for individual studies). Key data elements then\nwere extracted from each study. These were provided to the guideline\npanel and summarized by topic in the guideline document (see summary\nby topic in the comprehensive guideline document available online at\nhttps://www.braintrauma.org/coma/guidelines). Class 1 is the highest\nclass and is limited to good-quality randomized trials. Class 2 includes\nmoderate-quality randomized controlled trials and good-quality cohort\nor case-control studies. Class 3 is the lowest class and is given to lowquality randomized controlled trials, moderate- to low-quality cohort or\ncase control studies, and case series and other non-comparative designs.\nSynthesis\nThe final phase of the evidence review is the synthesis of individual\nstudies into information that the Clinical Investigators and the Methods\nTeam use to develop recommendations. This synthesis is described for\neach topic in the section titled Evaluation of the Evidence, after the\nRecommendations and preceding the Evidence Summary, which can\nbe found in the comprehensive guideline document available online at\nhttps://www.braintrauma.org/coma/guidelines.\nQuality of the Body of Evidence\nAssessing the quality of the body of evidence involves 4 domains: the\naggregate quality of the studies, the consistency of the results, whether\nthe evidence provided is direct or indirect, and the precision of the\nevidence. The criteria and ratings are outlined in the Methods section\nof the comprehensive guideline document, and more detailed definitions\nare in Appendix H. In addition, the number of studies and number of\nincluded subjects are considered. Based on these, an overall assessment is\nmade as to whether the quality of the body of evidence is high, moderate,\nlow, or insufficient. The assessment of the body of evidence for each\nsubtopic is included in a table in each topic section in the comprehensive\nguideline document (https://braintrauma.org/coma/guidelines).\nApplicability\nApplicability is the extent to which research findings are useful\nfor informing recommendations for a broader population (usually\nthe population that is the target of the recommendations).

{"id": "chunk_3_LEFT", "text": "CARNEY ET AL\nDerivation of Recommendations\nDevelopment of Recommendations\nClass 1, 2, and 3 studies constitute the evidence on which the\nrecommendations are based. Under our current methods, identification\nof evidence is necessary but not sufficient for the development of\nrecommendations. No recommendations were made without a basis in\nevidence.\nOnce evidence was identified, whether it could be used to inform\nrecommendations was based on the quality of the body of evidence\nand consideration of applicability. Given this, there were cases in which\nevidence was identified, but the quality was low, and applicability\nconcerns restricted the ability to translate the evidence into recommendations. Even if a recommendation was not made, the evidence was\nincluded to acknowledge its place in the body of evidence and make\nit accessible for future consideration. As new studies are generated and\nadded to the evidence base, we expect to see changes in the assessment of\nthe quality of the body of evidence.\nLevel of Recommendations\nRecommendations in this edition are designated as Level I, Level IIA, Level II-B, or Level III. The Level of Recommendation is determined\nby the assessment of the quality of the body of evidence, rather than the\nclass of the included studies.\nThe levels were primarily based on the quality of the body of evidence\nas follows:\n• Level I recommendations were based on a high-quality body of\nevidence.\n• Level IIA recommendations were based on a moderate-quality body\nof evidence.\n• Level IIB and III recommendations were based on a low-quality body\nof evidence.\nThe class of studies in the body of evidence was the basis for making\nthe distinction between a Level IIB or a Level III recommendation.\nLevel IIB recommendations were based on a body of evidence with Class\n2 studies that provided direct evidence but were of overall low quality.\nLevel III recommendations were based on Class 3 studies or on Class 2\nstudies providing only indirect evidence.\nConsideration of applicability could result in a Level III recommendation (eg, a “moderate-quality body of evidence” with significant applicability concerns). In this edition, applicability alone was not used to\ndowngrade a recommendation. Currently, there is a lack of standards and\ndeveloped methods in this area, so we elected to cite applicability issues\nthat were identified and discussed by the authors.\n“Insufficient” was used in cases in which the body of evidence was\ninsufficient to support a recommendation because there were no studies\nidentified or because the body of evidence had major quality limitations.\nIf the evidence was insufficient, no recommendation was made.\nRECOMMENDATIONS\nRevised Recommendations\nThere are now 28 evidence-based recommendations; 14 are\nnew or changed from the previous edition, while 14 have not\nchanged. These include 1 Level I, 7 Level IIA, 10 Level IIB, and\n10 Level III recommendations.

However, this\nprocedure has been demonstrated to reduce ICP and to minimize days in the ICU.\n• A large frontotemporoparietal DC (not less than 12 x 15 cm or 15 cm diameter) is recommended over a small\nfrontotemporoparietal DC for reduced mortality and improved neurologic outcomes in patients with\nsevere TBI.\n*The committee is aware that the results of the RESCUEicp trial2 were released soon after the completion of these\nGuidelines. The results of this trial may affect these recommendations and may need to be considered by treating\nphysicians and other users of these Guidelines. We intend to update these recommendations if needed. Updates\nwill be available at https://braintrauma.org/coma/guidelines.\nProphylactic hypothermia\nLevel IIB\n• Early (within 2.5 h), short-term (48 h post-injury), prophylactic hypothermia is not recommended to\nimprove outcomes in patients with diffuse injury.\nHyperosmolar therapy\nRecommendations from the prior (Third) Edition not supported by evidence meeting current standards.\nMannitol is effective for control of raised ICP at doses of 0.25 to 1 g/kg body weight. Arterial hypotension (systolic\nblood pressure <90 mm Hg) should be avoided.\nRestrict mannitol use prior to ICP monitoring to patients with signs of transtentorial herniation or progressive\nneurologic deterioration not attributable to extracranial causes.\nCerebrospinal fluid drainage\nLevel III\n• An EVD system zeroed at the midbrain with continuous drainage of CSF may be considered to lower ICP\nburden more effectively than intermittent use.\n• Use of CSF drainage to lower ICP in patients with an initial GCS <6 during the first 12 h after injury may be\nconsidered.\nVentilation therapies\nLevel IIB\n• Prolonged prophylactic hyperventilation with PaCO2 of ≤25 mm Hg is not recommended.\nRecommendations from the prior (Third) Edition not supported by evidence meeting current standards.\nHyperventilation is recommended as a temporizing measure for the reduction of elevated ICP.\nHyperventilation should be avoided during the first 24 h after injury when CBF often is reduced critically.\nIf hyperventilation is used, SjO2 or BtpO2 measurements are recommended to monitor oxygen delivery.\nAnesthetics, analgesics, and\nsedatives\nLevel IIB\n• Administration of barbiturates to induce burst suppression measured by EEG as prophylaxis against the\ndevelopment of intracranial hypertension is not recommended.\n• High-dose barbiturate administration is recommended to control elevated ICP refractory to maximum standard\nmedical and surgical treatment. Hemodynamic stability is essential before and during barbiturate therapy.\n• Although propofol is recommended for the control of ICP, it is not recommended for improvement in mortality or\n6-month outcomes. Caution is required as high-dose propofol can produce significant morbidity.3\nSteroids\nLevel I\n• The use of steroids is not recommended for improving outcome or reducing ICP. In patients with severe TBI,\nhigh-dose methylprednisolone was associated with increased mortality and is contraindicated.\nNutrition\nLevel IIA\n• Feeding patients to attain basal caloric replacement at least by the fifth day and at most by the seventh day\npost-injury is recommended to decrease mortality.\nLevel IIB\n• Transgastric jejunal feeding is recommended to reduce the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia.\nInfection prophylaxis\nLevel IIA\n• Early tracheostomy is recommended to reduce mechanical ventilation days when the overall benefit is thought to\noutweigh the complications associated with such a procedure. However, there is no evidence that early\ntracheostomy reduces mortality or the rate of nosocomial pneumonia.\n• The use of PI oral care is not recommended to reduce ventilator-associated pneumonia and may cause an\nincreased risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome.\nNEUROSURGERY\nVOLUME 80 | NUMBER 1 | JANUARY 2017 | 9", "page": 4, "side": "LEFT", "word_count": 638, "source": "Page 4 (LEFT)"}

Whether 60 or 70 mm Hg is the minimum optimal CPP threshold is unclear and may depend\nupon the autoregulatory status of the patient.\nLevel III\n• Avoiding aggressive attempts to maintain CPP >70 mm Hg with fluids and pressors may be considered\nbecause of the risk of adult respiratory failure.\nAdvanced cerebral monitoring\nLevel III\nthresholds\n• Jugular venous saturation of <50% may be a threshold to avoid in order to reduce mortality and improve\noutcomes.\naCPP, cerebral perfusion pressure; CT, computed tomography; ICP, intracranial pressure; RESCUEicp trial, Randomised Evaluation of Surgery with Craniectomy for Uncontrollable\nElevation of ICP; SBP, systolic blood pressure.\nbBold: New or revised recommendations.\nwill be necessary, but not sufficient, for the generation of strong\nevidence.\nNew Research Approaches\nIt is reasonable to consider how different research designs might\nbe used to identify which treatments work best, for whom, and\nunder what circumstances. This is the possibility of Comparative Effectiveness Research, which is being promoted by funding\nagencies and adopted by large consortium efforts in the brain\ntrauma research community. However, at the operational level,\nComparative Effectiveness Research still is subject to many of\nthe same vulnerabilities as traditional research, because it is\naccomplished using randomized controlled trials and observational studies. A transition to a new focus on Comparative Effectiveness Research must be accompanied by consistent adherence\nto evidence-based protocols.\nCONCLUSION\nOften, the available evidence is not sufficient to generate guidelines addressing the most critical questions faced by clinicians\n12 | VOLUME 80 | NUMBER 1 | JANUARY 2017\nwww.neurosurgery-online.com", "page": 7, "side": "LEFT", "word_count": 434, "source": "Page 7 (LEFT)"}

Although there have been some major developments in severe TBI management, for other topics in this edition\nit was not possible to make new evidence-based recommendations. The options are to wait for better evidence to be produced\nor to situate our reviews and guidelines in a larger enterprise.\nOur vision is a recursive structure that includes ongoing publication monitoring, systematic reviews and synthesis, and guidelines that then contribute back to the development and execution\nof a research agenda that can provide the evidence base for more\ncomprehensive guidelines. We anticipate that this agenda also\nwill promote the development and use of increasingly rigorous\nresearch methods in individual studies as well as reviews.
