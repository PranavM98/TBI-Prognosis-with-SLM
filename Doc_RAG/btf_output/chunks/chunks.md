Traumatic Brain Injury, Fourth Edition

The scope and purpose of this work is 2-fold: to synthesize the available evidence and
to translate it into recommendations. This document provides recommendations only
when there is evidence to support them. As such, they do not constitute a complete
protocol for clinical use. Our intention is that these recommendations be used by others
to develop treatment protocols, which necessarily need to incorporate consensus and
clinical judgment in areas where current evidence is lacking or insufficient. We think it is
important to have evidence-based recommendations to clarify what aspects of practice
currently can and cannot be supported by evidence, to encourage use of evidence-based
treatments that exist, and to encourage creativity in treatment and research in areas where
evidence does not exist. The communities of neurosurgery and neuro-intensive care have
been early pioneers and supporters of evidence-based medicine and plan to continue
in this endeavor. The complete guideline document, which summarizes and evaluates
the literature for each topic, and supplemental appendices (A-I) are available online at

more rigorous procedures for future work. As
a result, the guidelines include changes in the
evaluation of previous work, an increase in the
quality of the included studies, and essential
improvements in the precision of the recommendations. Details on the changes within each
topic from the Third1 to this Fourth Edition
are listed in Appendix A in the complete Fourth
Edition Guidelines and are described in the
sections on each topic in the comprehensive
guideline document. These are available online at
https://www.braintrauma.org/coma/guidelines.
Despite these improvements, the recommendations are limited in many areas, reflecting
persisting gaps in the evidence base for severe
traumatic brain injury (TBI) management.
Although there have been numerous new publications in the field since the Third Edition of
the Guidelines was published in 2007,1 many
repeat the same methodologic flaws found in
previous research. The comprehensive guideline
document includes an examination of the current
condition of brain trauma clinical research,
outlines how this condition is defining and
shaping the future, and proposes a solution in
establishing a formal evidence-based consortium.

Scope of the Guidelines
The guidelines address treatment interventions, monitoring,
and treatment thresholds that are specific to TBI or that address
a risk that is greater in patients with TBI. The guidelines are not
intended to cover all topics relevant to the care of patients with
severe TBI. Topics related to general good care for all patients, or
all trauma patients, are not included.
Developing protocols that integrate TBI-specific, evidencebased recommendations with general best practices for trauma
patients, and that provide guidance, suggestions, or options in
areas of TBI management where the evidence is insufficient, is
outside the scope of these guidelines. These recommendations
are intended to provide the foundation on which protocols can
be developed that are appropriate to different treatment environments.
Living Guidelines
This Fourth Edition of the Guidelines is transitional. We do
not intend to produce a Fifth Edition. Rather, we are moving
to a model of continuous monitoring of the literature, rapid
updates to the evidence review, and revisions to the recommendations as the evidence warrants. We call this the Living Guidelines model. This is driven by several trends, including advances in
technology, the increasing volume of available information, and
the corresponding change in expectations among clinicians and
other stakeholders. A static document that is updated after several
years no longer responds to the demands of the community we
serve.
The first test of this approach will involve incorporating the
results of the RESCUEicp (Randomised Evaluation of Surgery
with Craniectomy for Uncontrollable Elevation of ICP) study,
which was published just after the completion of this edition.
This study is a randomized, controlled trial that evaluates decompressive craniectomy as a secondary procedure, after ICP-targeted
medical therapies have failed.2 The results of this trial will be
evaluated and may impact recommendations related to decompressive craniectomy as well as ICP thresholds.
METHODS
The development of guidelines encompasses 2 major activities: first,
a systematic review and synthesis of evidence; and second, the derivation
of recommendations.
Systematic Evidence Review and Synthesis
Literature Search and Review
Our literature search protocol is detailed in the comprehensive
guideline document, and the search strategies are in Appendix D
to the same document. Both documents are available online at
https://www.braintrauma.org/coma/guidelines.
The key criteria for including studies in the review were as follows:
the population was adult patients with severe TBI (defined as Glasgow
Coma Scale Score of 3-8), and the study assessed an included outcome
(mortality; neurologic function; or appropriate, selected, intermediate

outcomes for the topic). Differences were resolved via consensus or by
a third reviewer. Detailed inclusion criteria and a list of studies excluded
after full-text review are in the comprehensive guideline document in
Appendices E and F.
Quality Assessment and Data Abstraction of Individual
Studies
All included studies were assessed for potential bias, which is a
systematic approach to assessing the internal validity or quality of
studies. The criteria used in the Third Edition were maintained and
applied to the newly identified studies of monitoring and treatments.
The criteria for threshold studies were revised to be specific to the
structure of threshold studies (see Appendix G for a complete list of
the quality criteria used for individual studies). Key data elements then
were extracted from each study. These were provided to the guideline
panel and summarized by topic in the guideline document (see summary
by topic in the comprehensive guideline document available online at
https://www.braintrauma.org/coma/guidelines). Class 1 is the highest
class and is limited to good-quality randomized trials. Class 2 includes
moderate-quality randomized controlled trials and good-quality cohort
or case-control studies. Class 3 is the lowest class and is given to lowquality randomized controlled trials, moderate- to low-quality cohort or
case control studies, and case series and other non-comparative designs.
Synthesis
The final phase of the evidence review is the synthesis of individual
studies into information that the Clinical Investigators and the Methods
Team use to develop recommendations. This synthesis is described for
each topic in the section titled Evaluation of the Evidence, after the
Recommendations and preceding the Evidence Summary, which can
be found in the comprehensive guideline document available online at
https://www.braintrauma.org/coma/guidelines.
Quality of the Body of Evidence
Assessing the quality of the body of evidence involves 4 domains: the
aggregate quality of the studies, the consistency of the results, whether
the evidence provided is direct or indirect, and the precision of the
evidence. The criteria and ratings are outlined in the Methods section
of the comprehensive guideline document, and more detailed definitions
are in Appendix H. In addition, the number of studies and number of
included subjects are considered. Based on these, an overall assessment is
made as to whether the quality of the body of evidence is high, moderate,
low, or insufficient. The assessment of the body of evidence for each
subtopic is included in a table in each topic section in the comprehensive
guideline document (https://braintrauma.org/coma/guidelines).
Applicability
Applicability is the extent to which research findings are useful
for informing recommendations for a broader population (usually
the population that is the target of the recommendations). Refer
to
the
comprehensive
guideline
document
available
online
at
https://www.braintrauma.org/coma/guidelines for a complete definition
of Applicability. In this edition, we consider the applicability of
individual studies in the Quality of the Body of Evidence and Applicability section immediately after the recommendations.

CARNEY ET AL
Derivation of Recommendations
Development of Recommendations
Class 1, 2, and 3 studies constitute the evidence on which the
recommendations are based. Under our current methods, identification
of evidence is necessary but not sufficient for the development of
recommendations. No recommendations were made without a basis in
evidence.
Once evidence was identified, whether it could be used to inform
recommendations was based on the quality of the body of evidence
and consideration of applicability. Given this, there were cases in which
evidence was identified, but the quality was low, and applicability
concerns restricted the ability to translate the evidence into recommendations. Even if a recommendation was not made, the evidence was
included to acknowledge its place in the body of evidence and make
it accessible for future consideration. As new studies are generated and
added to the evidence base, we expect to see changes in the assessment of
the quality of the body of evidence.
Level of Recommendations
Recommendations in this edition are designated as Level I, Level IIA, Level II-B, or Level III. The Level of Recommendation is determined
by the assessment of the quality of the body of evidence, rather than the
class of the included studies.
The levels were primarily based on the quality of the body of evidence
as follows:
• Level I recommendations were based on a high-quality body of
evidence.
• Level IIA recommendations were based on a moderate-quality body
of evidence.
• Level IIB and III recommendations were based on a low-quality body
of evidence.
The class of studies in the body of evidence was the basis for making
the distinction between a Level IIB or a Level III recommendation.
Level IIB recommendations were based on a body of evidence with Class
2 studies that provided direct evidence but were of overall low quality.
Level III recommendations were based on Class 3 studies or on Class 2
studies providing only indirect evidence.
Consideration of applicability could result in a Level III recommendation (eg, a “moderate-quality body of evidence” with significant applicability concerns). In this edition, applicability alone was not used to
downgrade a recommendation. Currently, there is a lack of standards and
developed methods in this area, so we elected to cite applicability issues
that were identified and discussed by the authors.
“Insufficient” was used in cases in which the body of evidence was
insufficient to support a recommendation because there were no studies
identified or because the body of evidence had major quality limitations.
If the evidence was insufficient, no recommendation was made.
RECOMMENDATIONS
Revised Recommendations
There are now 28 evidence-based recommendations; 14 are
new or changed from the previous edition, while 14 have not
changed. These include 1 Level I, 7 Level IIA, 10 Level IIB, and
10 Level III recommendations. There are 7 Third Edition recom8 | VOLUME 80 | NUMBER 1 | JANUARY 2017

mendations that are restated here but are no longer substantiated
by evidence meeting current standards.
Tables 1, 2, and 3 provide the recommendations for treatments, monitoring, and thresholds, respectively. In these tables,
the recommendations in bold are new or have been revised;
those in regular text have not changed. The comprehensive
guideline document available online includes a section on each
topic consisting of an Introduction, Recommendations, Evaluation of the Evidence, and Summary of the Evidence (including
narrative and evidence tables).
Treatment Recommendations
Table 1 contains the recommendations for 11 treatments that
are either specific to the in-hospital management of severe TBI
or are related to risks experienced by patients with TBI. The
topics that are included reflect current practice but are expected
to change as new treatments are developed that may replace or
complement existing treatments.
Decompressive craniectomy and cerebrospinal fluid drainage
are new topics to this edition, so the recommendations for
these topics also are new. Other changes include revision of the
hypothermia, nutrition and infection prophylaxis recommendations, and a statement in the seizure prophylaxis topic that there
is not yet sufficient evidence to support a recommendation about
levetiracetam, despite its widespread use. The recommendations
for anesthetics have not changed, but we updated the reference
to the Food and Drug Administration warning that high doses
of propofol can increase the risk of morbidity.3 A list of the 41
studies that constitute the new evidence informing these recommendations is cited by topic in Table 4.4-44
Monitoring Recommendations
It is not monitoring per se that affects outcomes; rather, it
is using the information from monitoring to direct treatment.
Treatment informed by data from monitoring may result in
better outcomes than treatment informed solely by data from
clinical assessment. These recommendations are related to
the influence on patient outcomes of 3 types of monitoring:
ICP, cerebral perfusion pressure monitoring, and advanced
cerebral monitoring. Although we reviewed and report on
these monitoring modalities separately, it is important to
acknowledge
that
clinical
practice
in
most
high-income
countries incorporates multiple monitoring approaches as
well as ongoing clinical assessment. As such, treatment decisions
are not made using one source of information in isolation.
Conversely,
limited
resources
in
low-and-middle-income
countries often do not allow for technology-based monitoring,
and medical decisions may be driven by clinical assessment
alone. Therefore, the application of these guidelines will vary
depending upon the medical environment in which they are
used.
Table 2 contains revised recommendations for all 3 types of
monitoring. New evidence cited in Table 4 has led to revisions to

TABLE 1. Updated Treatment Recommendationsa,b
Topic
Recommendations
Decompressive craniectomy
Level IIA
• Bifrontal DC is not recommended to improve outcomes as measured by the GOS-E score at 6 mo post-injury
in severe TBI patients with diffuse injury (without mass lesions), and with ICP elevation to values >20 mm
Hg for more than 15 min within a 1-h period that are refractory to first-tier therapies. However, this
procedure has been demonstrated to reduce ICP and to minimize days in the ICU.
• A large frontotemporoparietal DC (not less than 12 x 15 cm or 15 cm diameter) is recommended over a small
frontotemporoparietal DC for reduced mortality and improved neurologic outcomes in patients with
severe TBI.
*The committee is aware that the results of the RESCUEicp trial2 were released soon after the completion of these
Guidelines. The results of this trial may affect these recommendations and may need to be considered by treating
physicians and other users of these Guidelines. We intend to update these recommendations if needed. Updates
will be available at https://braintrauma.org/coma/guidelines.
Prophylactic hypothermia
Level IIB
• Early (within 2.5 h), short-term (48 h post-injury), prophylactic hypothermia is not recommended to
improve outcomes in patients with diffuse injury.
Hyperosmolar therapy
Recommendations from the prior (Third) Edition not supported by evidence meeting current standards.
Mannitol is effective for control of raised ICP at doses of 0.25 to 1 g/kg body weight. Arterial hypotension (systolic
blood pressure <90 mm Hg) should be avoided.
Restrict mannitol use prior to ICP monitoring to patients with signs of transtentorial herniation or progressive
neurologic deterioration not attributable to extracranial causes.
Cerebrospinal fluid drainage
Level III
• An EVD system zeroed at the midbrain with continuous drainage of CSF may be considered to lower ICP
burden more effectively than intermittent use.
• Use of CSF drainage to lower ICP in patients with an initial GCS <6 during the first 12 h after injury may be
considered.
Ventilation therapies
Level IIB
• Prolonged prophylactic hyperventilation with PaCO2 of ≤25 mm Hg is not recommended.
Recommendations from the prior (Third) Edition not supported by evidence meeting current standards.
Hyperventilation is recommended as a temporizing measure for the reduction of elevated ICP.
Hyperventilation should be avoided during the first 24 h after injury when CBF often is reduced critically.
If hyperventilation is used, SjO2 or BtpO2 measurements are recommended to monitor oxygen delivery.
Anesthetics, analgesics, and
sedatives
Level IIB
• Administration of barbiturates to induce burst suppression measured by EEG as prophylaxis against the
development of intracranial hypertension is not recommended.
• High-dose barbiturate administration is recommended to control elevated ICP refractory to maximum standard
medical and surgical treatment. Hemodynamic stability is essential before and during barbiturate therapy.
• Although propofol is recommended for the control of ICP, it is not recommended for improvement in mortality or
6-month outcomes. Caution is required as high-dose propofol can produce significant morbidity.3
Steroids
Level I
• The use of steroids is not recommended for improving outcome or reducing ICP. In patients with severe TBI,
high-dose methylprednisolone was associated with increased mortality and is contraindicated.
Nutrition
Level IIA
• Feeding patients to attain basal caloric replacement at least by the fifth day and at most by the seventh day
post-injury is recommended to decrease mortality.
Level IIB
• Transgastric jejunal feeding is recommended to reduce the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia.
Infection prophylaxis
Level IIA
• Early tracheostomy is recommended to reduce mechanical ventilation days when the overall benefit is thought to
outweigh the complications associated with such a procedure. However, there is no evidence that early
tracheostomy reduces mortality or the rate of nosocomial pneumonia.
• The use of PI oral care is not recommended to reduce ventilator-associated pneumonia and may cause an
increased risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Level III
• Antimicrobial-impregnated catheters may be considered to prevent catheter-related infections during
external ventricular drainage.
Deep vein thrombosis
Prophylaxis
Level III
• LMWH or low-dose unfractioned heparin may be used in combination with mechanical prophylaxis. However,
there is an increased risk for expansion of intracranial hemorrhage.
• In addition to compression stockings, pharmacologic prophylaxis may be considered if the brain injury is
stable and the benefit is considered to outweigh the risk of increased intracranial hemorrhage.
• There is insufficient evidence to support recommendations regarding the preferred agent, dose, or timing of
pharmacologic prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis.
Seizure prophylaxis
Level IIA
• Prophylactic use of phenytoin or valproate is not recommended for preventing late PTS.
• Phenytoin is recommended to decrease the incidence of early PTS (within 7 d of injury), when the overall
benefit is thought to outweigh the complications associated with such treatment. However, early PTS have
not been associated with worse outcomes.
• At the present time there is insufficient evidence to recommend levetiracetam compared with
phenytoin regarding efficacy in preventing early post-traumatic seizures and toxicity.

the ICP and cerebral perfusion pressure monitoring recommendations.
Threshold Recommendations
These recommendations are related to threshold values
for parameters that are monitored during the in-hospital
management of patients with severe TBI. In this Fourth Edition,
we include thresholds for blood pressure, ICP, cerebral perfusion
pressure, and advanced cerebral monitoring. The threshold can
be a value to avoid in order to decrease the probability of negative
outcomes or a value to aim for in order to increase the probability
of positive outcomes, and it can be a value that triggers a change
in treatment.
DISCUSSION
New Evidence
In updating the recommendations, 102 articles were added to
the body of evidence. These fall into 3 categories. The 41 studies
listed in Table 4 contributed to additions or changes to the recommendations. Table 4 lists these by topic and includes basic information about the studies, including study design, the number of
patients included (N), and the data class. More details, including
outcomes and results, are included in the evidence tables and
narrative in the comprehensive guideline document available
online at https://www.braintrauma.org/coma/guidelines.

Another 27 studies present new evidence, but, for various
reasons (eg, single studies with small samples, inconsistent results
across studies, lack of precision), they were assessed as insufficient to support adding or changing a recommendation. The
remaining 34 new studies met the inclusion criteria, but they
supplement the findings of the previous research that informed
existing recommendations and did not change the findings or
the strength of evidence. All the included studies are cited and
discussed in the comprehensive guideline document available
online at https://www.braintrauma.org/coma/guidelines.
Future Research
Management of patients with TBI is not a function of
the application of individual treatments. No treatment or
management approach exists independent of other treatments
and approaches, or independent of the ecology. The design of
meaningful and effective future research needs to be consistent
with this clinical reality. The brain trauma community needs to
design and engage in a systematic process for developing a research
agenda that begins with thoughtful conversations about scope,
topics, management environments, and research methods. The
process should include (1) identification and refinement of topics
for studies that could serve to fill critical gaps in the guidelines,
(2) improvement of study designs, and (3) incorporation of stateof-the-art methods for synthesizing literature, assessing bodies of
evidence, and generating guidelines.

Recommendations
Intracranial pressure monitoring
Level IIB
• Management of severe TBI patients using information from ICP monitoring is recommended to
reduce in-hospital and 2-week post-injury mortality.
Recommendations from the prior (Third) Edition not supported by evidence meeting current standards.
ICP should be monitored in all salvageable patients with a TBI (GCS 3-8 after resuscitation) and an abnormal
CT scan. An abnormal CT scan of the head is one that reveals hematomas, contusions, swelling, herniation,
or compressed basal cisterns.
ICP monitoring is indicated in patients with severe TBI with a normal CT scan if ≥2 of the following features
are noted at admission: age >40 years, unilateral or bilateral motor posturing, or SBP <90 mm Hg.
Cerebral perfusion pressure
monitoring
Level IIB
• Management of severe TBI patients using guidelines-based recommendations for CPP monitoring is

• Jugular bulb monitoring of AVDO2, as a source of information for management decisions, may be
considered to reduce mortality and improve outcomes at 3 and 6 mo post-injury.

Individual Studies
We could begin the critical self-examination of our research
methods by returning to the recommendations of the Clinical
Trials in Head Injury Study Group.45 They encouraged (in part):
• Identification and testing of specific (appropriate) subgroups of
patients with TBI
• Standardized clinical management across centers
• Independent monitoring of patient management and data
quality
• Parsimonious data collection
• Identification of relevant outcome measures and adequate time
to follow-up
• Identification of clinically relevant effect size
A useful exercise might be to examine the extent to which
our community is adhering to these recommendations and to
fundamental tenets of evidence-based medicine in the design
and conduct of our current work. That only will be useful
if done inside a full recognition of the current paradigm
for conducting clinical research. Unfortunately, the realities of
conducting clinical research sometimes compromise sound scientific methods. Moving from a pilot to a full-scale study may
include:
• Revision of, and heterogeneity in, inclusion criteria to increase
sample size
• Revision of the protocol for delivering the intervention
• An increase in the number of research centers to increase
sample size and to speed recruitment in order to decrease study

duration, resulting in a lack of standardized management across
multiple centers
• Expanded data collection to meet multiple agency requirements
• Outcome measures that may not be clinically relevant
• Shortened time to complete follow-up
• Effect size requirements that may be statistically, but not clinically, relevant
• Budget constraints
The rationale for subjecting an effective single-center trial to
the variability encountered in a large multi-center trial is valid.
Ideally, a treatment should be effective across various clinical
environments. However, failure at the multi-center level could
be the result of factors other than, or in addition to, lack of a
robust treatment effect. Variability in research protocols, patient
assessments, and data collection and management could be
washing out the potential effects of the interventions we are
studying.
Also in the spirit of critical self-examination is this question:
What does our community need to do to produce a substantial
and permanent shift in the quality of the studies we are generating? The direct approach of wagging the evidence-based finger
is not changing research practice. What is in the background of
our worldview and frame of reference for research that is influencing our selection of research models and designs? How does
the current paradigm for brain trauma allow for the persistence
of studies that use designs and protocols we know in advance will
not produce strong evidence? Discovery at this contextual level

Topic
Recommendations
Blood pressure thresholds
Level III
• Maintaining SBP at ≥100 mm Hg for patients 50 to 69 years old or at ≥110 mm Hg or above for
patients 15 to 49 or >70 years old may be considered to decrease mortality and improve outcomes.
Intracranial pressure thresholds
Level IIB
• Treating ICP >22 mm Hg is recommended because values above this level are associated with
increased mortality.
Level III
• A combination of ICP values and clinical and brain CT findings may be used to make management
decisions.
*The committee is aware that the results of the RESCUEicp trial2 were released after the completion of these
Guidelines. The results of this trial may affect these recommendations and may need to be considered by
treating physicians and other users of these Guidelines. We intend to update these recommendations if
needed. Updates will be available at https://braintrauma.org/coma/guidelines.
Cerebral perfusion pressure
Level IIB
thresholds
• The recommended target CPP value for survival and favorable outcomes is between 60 and 70 mm
Hg. Whether 60 or 70 mm Hg is the minimum optimal CPP threshold is unclear and may depend
upon the autoregulatory status of the patient.
Level III
• Avoiding aggressive attempts to maintain CPP >70 mm Hg with fluids and pressors may be considered
because of the risk of adult respiratory failure.
Advanced cerebral monitoring

New Research Approaches
It is reasonable to consider how different research designs might
be used to identify which treatments work best, for whom, and
under what circumstances. This is the possibility of Comparative Effectiveness Research, which is being promoted by funding
agencies and adopted by large consortium efforts in the brain
trauma research community. However, at the operational level,
Comparative Effectiveness Research still is subject to many of
the same vulnerabilities as traditional research, because it is
accomplished using randomized controlled trials and observational studies. A transition to a new focus on Comparative Effectiveness Research must be accompanied by consistent adherence
to evidence-based protocols.
CONCLUSION
Often, the available evidence is not sufficient to generate guidelines addressing the most critical questions faced by clinicians

and patients. Although there have been some major developments in severe TBI management, for other topics in this edition
it was not possible to make new evidence-based recommendations. The options are to wait for better evidence to be produced
or to situate our reviews and guidelines in a larger enterprise.
Our vision is a recursive structure that includes ongoing publication monitoring, systematic reviews and synthesis, and guidelines that then contribute back to the development and execution
of a research agenda that can provide the evidence base for more
comprehensive guidelines. We anticipate that this agenda also
will promote the development and use of increasingly rigorous
research methods in individual studies as well as reviews. A
detailed and comprehensive future research agenda is provided
in the comprehensive guideline document available online at
